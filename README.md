5th Edition D&amp;D SRD Converted to Sci-Fi

## Compiling
If you wish to compile the SRD for yourself you will need Ruby installed. Simply run:
> ruby compile.rb <version_string>

## Contributing
The entire 5e SRD has been added to this repository, however only sections that have been converted are compiled. If you convert a section of the SRD that is not being compiled, just add the file name as a merge tag in the format [[relative/path/to/file]] to the appropriate location in main.md, and the script will compile it. The console output will tell you if you have any invalid merge tags.

Create a pull request with your changes, and it will be reviewed as soon as possible.
