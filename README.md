# sci-fi-5e
5th edition D&amp;D SRD converted to use in a science fiction campaign setting.

I have been a lifelong fan of science fiction, and there is no better RPG system than 5th edition D&D. This is an attempt to join the two together; bring the familiar rules of 5th edition D&D together with a refreshing new universe of roleplay possibilities.

The goal is to change as little as possible mechanically, and reflavor the mechanics, classes, spells, and monsters to be compatible with a sci-fi campaign setting, and continue building onto it.

Inside you'll find content inspired by fiction such as Red Rising, Altered Carbon, Ender's Game, The Expanse, and more. I would love to collaborrate to build a rich RPG sandbox to play in.

## Compiling
If you wish to compile the SRD for yourself you will need Ruby installed. Simply run:
> ruby compile.rb <version_string>

## Contributing
The entire 5e SRD has been added to this repository, however only sections that have been converted are compiled. If you convert a section of the SRD that is not being compiled, just add the file name as a merge tag in the format [[relative/path/to/file]] to the appropriate location in main.md, and the script will compile it. The console output will tell you if you have any invalid merge tags.

Create a pull request with your changes, and it will be reviewed as soon as possible.
