# Mercenary Squads

### Squad Combat

Whether you employ a squad of mercenaries, or your organization has mercenaries in their service, having a squad of marines at your back is essential for many types of incursions. A group of marines can be broken up into any number of squads, but each squad will only take orders from 1 PC leader.

Mercenaries are expendable soldiers that can make or break any combat engagement. Many mercenaries have EGO insurance ensuring that if they are killed in battle, they will receive a new Skin. Real death is rare among mercenaries, and most will avoid aiming for the EGO of a fellow mercenary as honor demands.

Mercenaries do well against other mercenaries and weaker foes, but against a more formidable foe, such as a razor wielding lancer, they will be torn apart.

### Mercenary Salary
Mercenaries should be too expensive to keep around full time. Rather they should be employed in specific scenarios. Mercenary pay should scale with level. If the party's' benifactor supplies squads of marines, they might only supply them on missions that call for it.

### Combat Mechanics

Mercenary squads roll initiative as a group with no initiative bonus. A PC squad leader can give orders to their squad with a bonus action. The squad will continue to follow that order until told differently. You can specify specific members of the squad with the order. Other squad members will continue with their previous orders. For example, if a squad is ordered to attack the enemy, they are intellgient enough to seek a new target when their target has been taken out. Mercenaries can be considered NPCs per the DM's discression. It may make combat move more quickly if you want to simplify the PC involvement to just giving orders.

### Taking Damage
When a mercenary takes damage from an attack, they must make a saving throw with a DC equal to the amount of damage taken. On a failed save, the mercenary is a casualty, and cannot continue fighting.

### Recovering Casualties
If you are able to recover casualties after combat, for each mercenary casualty roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, the mercenary can recover over a long rest. On a failure, the mercenary was not able to be saved, but their EGO can be recovered. Some mercenary companies might charge a fee for lost or destroyed mercenary EGOs, and expect you to recover EGOs of those that fall in battle.

### Leadership Inspiration

With the Inspiring Leader feat, your squad of marines gain +2 to initiative rolls, and +2 to Armor Class. This bonus only applies to mercenaries directly under your command.
