## Weapons

#### Ion Weapons

Bladed weapons forged with modern day technology are much stronger than their iron ansestors. Their molecular structure makes them better for getting through weaker pulse armor.

#### Pulse Weapons

Powered melee weapons designed to pierce through modern armor. Especially effective against pulse armor.

#### Scorcher
A pistol that fires superheated metal.

### New Weapon Properties

Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.


**_Burst-Fire._** Weapons with this trait fire multiple rounds of ammunition per round. You roll once to hit, but roll damage separately for each round of ammunition.

**_Loading._** Weapons with this trait need to be reloaded after firing a certain number of times. For example a Rail Rifle fires 3 rounds of ammunition per round, and requires to be reloaded every 10 attacks, meaning its clips hold 30 rounds of ammunition.

**_Hidden._** This weapon can be disguised as an ordinary object with a Stealth check. It takes a bonus action to unsheathe.

## Armor

The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor worn in futuristic gaming worlds.

**_Armor Proficiency._** Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap A Pulse Shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor's use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't cast tek skills.

**_Armor Class (AC)._** Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class.

**_Heavy Armor._** Heavier armor interferes with the wearer's ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows “Str 13” or “Str 15” in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the wearer's speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.

**_Stealth._** If the Armor table shows “Disadvantage” in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

**_Pulse Shields._** A Pulse Shields is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding A Pulse Shields increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.

#### Light Armor

Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.

**_scarab skin._** Lightweight metal lined combat armor.

**_Pulse Armor._** Powered by a small generator, this expensive shielding deflects projectiles. Once depleted it takes time to recharge. Pulse armor can be quite expensive, but ideal if you are trying to keep a low profile.

#### Medium Armor

Medium armor offers more protection than light armor, but it also impairs movement more. If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.

**_flak armor._** Made of interlocking metal rings, a scarab skin is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This armor offers modest protection to the wearer's upper body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against one another to be muffled by outer layers.

**_Kevlar._** Basic military issue combat armor.

#### Heavy Armor

Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk.

Heavy armor doesn't let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn't penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative.

**_Power Shell._** Heavy and cumbersome, this powered mech armor gives the wearer enhanced strength, and a tough shell more resistant to damage than the standard pulse armor. However it makes it very difficult to be stealthy. This armor gives the wearer +2 Strength.

<div class='wide'>
##### Armor

| Name | Cost | Armor Class (AC) | Strength | Stealth | Weight | Don/Doff |
|--------------------|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|--------|----------|
| **_Light Armor_** | | | | | | |
| scarab skin | 4,500 credits | 12 + Dex modifier | — | — | 13 kg.| 1 minute|
| pulse armor | 20,000 credits | 13 + Dex modifier | — | — | 13 kg. | 1 action |
| **_Medium Armor_** | | | | | ||
| flak armor | 5,000 credits | 13 + Dex modifier (max 2) | — | — | 20 kg. |5/1 minutes|
| kevlar | 10,000 credits | 14 + Dex modifier (max 2) | — | Disadvantage | 45 kg. | 5/1 minutes|
| **_Heavy Armor_** | | | | | ||
| star shell | 150,000 credits | 18 | Str 5 | Disadvantage | 650 kg. |10/5 minutes |
| **_Shield_** | | | | | ||
| pulse shield | 50,000 credits | +2 | — | — | 6 kg. |1 action|


#### Getting Into and Out of Armor

The time it takes to don or doff armor depends on the armor's category.

**_Don._** This is the time it takes to put on armor. You benefit from the armor's AC only if you take the full time to don the suit of armor.

**_Doff._** This is the time it takes to take off armor. If you have help, reduce this time by half.

## Adventuring Gear

Below is a list of common freelancer gear.

**_Acid (vial)._** A strong acid that can melt through biological and metalic material. Takes 1d4 hours per inch of metal.

When thrown on a creature, the creature must make a DC 14 dexterity save or take 2d6 acid damage.

**_Antitoxin._** A creature that injects this vial of liquid gains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to undead or synthetics.

**_Caltrops._** As an action, you can spread a bag of caltrops to cover a square area that is 5 feet on a side. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving this turn and take 1 piercing damage. Taking this damage reduces the creature's walking speed by 10 feet until the creature regains at least 1 hit point. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn't need to make the save. Caltrops can be coated in poison to do additional damage.

Handcuffs have 15 hit points.

**_Magboots._** Boots that magnetize to surface improving mobility in null-g environments. They must be activated with an action.

## Currency Conversion

Currency is mostly dealt with in digital credits, however coins are still in circulation.

With one 100 credits, a character can buy a bedroll, 50 carbon fiber rope, or a low end datapad. A skilled (but not exceptional) worker can earn 100 credits a day.

50 credits buys a laborer's work for half a day, a night in a low end hostel, or a few rounds of drinks at a pub.

A single credit buys a pack of gum, small flashlight, or a bottle of water.

Coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp). Coin denominations are the same as standard D&D so it makes it easy to convert the value of goods and services.
