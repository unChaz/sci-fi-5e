# Space Travel

## Ship Maneuvers

Space encounters should be kept simple, and contained in the theater of the mind. The players should know what their ship has at their disposal. You describe the situation, and the pilot describes the maneuver they wish to perform. They make a piloting check against a DC determined by the DM.

<br>

>### Short and Sweet
>Ship encounters should be short, simple, and cinematic. In this universe, the point of ship to ship combat is not to destroy, but commandeer enemy vessels. These huge ships take trillions of credits of wealth, and years to build. Squandering all that for an easy victory is generally considered foolish, and dishonorable.

<br>

### Available Maneuvers

##### Match Velocity
Whether engaging an enemy vessel, rendevouzing with an ally, or just docking at a space station, you always have to match velocity first. This can be done in most cases without a roll, but if you are attempting to match velocity with a fleeing ship, you must make a (dexterity) piloting check. If a ship is actively evading you, your ship must be able to match the max thrust of the ship you are pursuing.

##### Rendevouz
Once you have matched velocity with another vessel, you must close the distance before docking. This can be done without a piloting check unless approaching an enemy, or alien vessel. The result of a successful rendevous is to be within range of a vessel or station to dock or fire weapons.

##### Dock
Docking is a trivial procedure in most cases, and won't require a roll. However, a ship under fire might be pressed to dock more rapidly, in which case a roll may be required.

##### Evasive Maneuvers
If under fire, and trying to escape, you can fly the ship evasively to avoid oncoming enemy fire. This action gives any attacking ship disadvantage on attack rolls.

##### Engage Cloak
If the ship contains any stealth technology, the pilot can make a dexterity (stealth) check. Until the cloak is disabled, enemy ships have disadvantage when making perception checks to detect you. Firing weapons will immediately break the cloak.

##### Boarding
If you need to force entry into a vessel or station, you must make the boarding maneuver. Roll a piloting check against the AC of the enemy vessel. You have advantage if the ship's hull is at half HP, or if the vessel is unaware of your presence.

```
```

##### Fire Weapons
If attacking a ship of similar size or smaller, the ships weapons can be fired effectively. Size differences in ships are so great that a smaller ship's weapons would have little effect against a larger ship unless the larger ship was severely outnumbered.

To fire weapons you must be in range of the enemy vessel through a successful rendevouz maneuver.

You then must target a specific subsystem of the ship.

### Ship Subsystems
Each subsystem has the same AC and HP. A subsystem is disabled at half HP, and destroyed at 0.

#### Life Support
By disabling or destroying this system, you've emptied the ship of breathable air. Keep in mind that this does not affect anyone aboard the ship wearing an EVA suit. A disabled life support system can be repaired by an engineer within a few days without going into dry dock. A destroyed life support system must be replaced.

#### Engineering
By disabling engineering, you render the ship propulsion useless. This may be desirable for a fleeing ship. Like life support systems, it can be repaird in a few days. Destroying engineering causes a chain reaction that will tear apart the entire vessel.

#### Weapons
If you disable weapons systems the ship will not be able to make the attack action. Destroyed weapons systems must be replaced in dry dock.

#### Hull
Dealing damage to the hull will make it easier to breach. Holes in the hull can be triaged by locking down certain sections of the ship to protect the rest of the ship from the vacuum of space. Destroyed hull means the destruction of the entire ship.

<br>
<br>

>##### Ship Repair
>An engineer can spend a day repairing a ship, and roll one of its hit die for a specific subsystem. Once a ship subsystem is above half HP, it is functional again. Certain subsystems can be repaired in flight. The propulsion systems, however, cannot be used while the engineering subsystem is being repaired. Also weapons cannot be fired on a day that is spent repairing the weapons systems.

## Vehicles

##### Ship Stats
Each ship class has a stat block outlining its Speed, AC, HP, Hit Dice, and weapon damage. It also has a list of features of the ship, such as general cargo size, crew capacity, and hull length.

### Basic Vehicles

#### Grav Boots
You gain flying speed equal to your walking speed.

#### Hover Bike
While mounted, your speed is 60ft. Can carry 1 additional passenger.

#### Aircar

#### Cargo Vessels

Cargo vessels are usually categorized by size: small, medium, large. Cargo ships can range from 40m, to the massive 1km long ships. Cargo vesseles are also categorized by type. The most common types you will find are gas, ice, and container. Gas vessels often have massive gas tanks attached to the side. Ice haulers are usually a giant warehouse size box, with the crew cabins along the outside and the thrusters arranged around a single massive cargo bay door. Container vessels are either a long cylyndrical ship that attaches huge containers of goods on the outsides. Some cargo container ships have a large pressurized cargo housing, and cargo is loaded through docking ports.
