# The Cryo-Emergent Handbook

## Introduction

Welcome to your new life! The Sol Commerce Authority (SCA) is responsible for reorienting all preserved Natural Humans into this new world.

Centuries ago it was common practice for terminally ill humans, or those with vast resources to facilitate the cryogenic preservation of their bodies to be revived when scientific advancement allowed.

SCA legislation HL-3404-C53 dictates that all cryogenically preserved pre-stack natural humans that have not been revived to be confiscated by the SCA. Your consciousness has been legally conscripted into indentured servitude to the SCA until you have paid off your contract.

You were not revived for one of the following reasons:

- Your sleeve was damaged and unsuitable to be revived.
- Your cryo insurance coverage was not comprehensive enough to cover the cost of sleeve repair.
- Your cryo insurance agency was waiting for your sleeve repair costs to become lower.
- The contract on your revival designated a date after HL-3404-C53 went into effect.

## Persona
SCA assesses each emergent, and determines a score for each of the four primary conscious assessment ability scores as determined by the Ganymede Institute of Psychology.

| Ability Score | Description|
|:----:|:-------------|
| Wit  | Mental sharpness and inventiveness; keen intelligence. |
| Fortitude | Courage in pain or adversity. This is the mind's ability to resist tek effectrs, and mental stress. |
| Intelligence | The ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills. |
| Wisdom | The soundness of an action or decision with regard to the application of experience, knowledge, and good judgment. |

<br>

> ### Calculating Ability Scores
> Each ability score is calculated by rolling 4d6, dropping the lowest, subtract 10, and divide by 2 rounding up. This simplifies ability scores to a single number instead of a modifier and a score that is never used. During ability score improvements, instead of getting +1 to two ability scores, you get +1 to a single score.

```
```

### Stack

Each human is given a "stack" that is installed at the base of the neck connected to your spinal cord. The Stack contains a complete record of your conscious mind. In the event of your death you can obtain a new body. Additionally, traveling across the solar system has never been faster with the ability to stream your stack backup to a different body. If you have the funds, you can even have a cloned body ready for you on the other side.

If your stack is destroyed however, there is no bringing you back. That is called "true death". The punishment for murder has been lessened with the exception of those who have religious encoding specifying they do not wish to be spun back up.

Having two copies or more of the same stack is illegal, and punishable by the true death of all copies.

It is also possible to enter into a totally virtual environment via the stack. Using this method we can spin up a virtual instance of a person in VR to question them about thier death, or keep prisoners inside a virtual environment indefinitely.

## Sleeve

A "sleeve" is what the transhuman body is now referred to. Upon death, if your stack is recovered, you can purchase a new sleeve, or be provided one in the case of wrongful death, or if you are properly insured.

### Quality Control
All sleeves must be appraised by the **Board of Quality Control** to ensure buyer protection. Sleeves are appraised with the following ability scores.


| Ability Score | Description |
|:----:|:-------------|
|Strength |Physical strength |
|Dexterity | Agility, reflex, and balance |
|Physique | Beauty, appearance |
|Constitution | Overall health |


### Fortitude
Constitution is merely a physical attribute. Fortitude is its mental counterpart. Together they make up your ability to resist physical pain. Your hit points, and constitution saving throws are calculated based on the highest between fortitude and constitution.

### Charisma
Charisma is split into Physique and Wit. Charisma is calculated as the highest of the two. Whichever ability is your highest-- wit or physique, determines how you use those abilities. Some skills require one or the other. For example, deception uses wit whereas charm uses physique.

## Tekcasting
The discovery of alien technology has led to the ability for humans to obtain seemingly supernatural powers.

### Tek Arcana
Tek Arcana is the term that refers to the use of alien technology to produce effects that we cannot understand scientifically. Those who study Tek Arcana are called Arcanists, and those that tinker with alien devices are called Artificers.

### Tekcaster
The tool used by those to cast tek skills is called a Tekcaster. The tekcaster is a device worn on the wrist and is connected to the fingers. Using a combination of hand movements, vocal commands, and material components, the tekcaster can be used to cast tek skills.

One can wield a weapon while wearing a tekcaster, but the hand must be free to use it. The tekcaster uses a gemstone as its power source. Depending on the requirements of the tek skill, the gem may be destroyed and must be replaced. Some tek skills require better quality gems.

```
```

<br><br><br>

>
> ### Material Components
> In Sci-5, material components have been simplified to only gemstones. Any spell that has a specified value of components can be converted to "n credits worth of a gem".
>
> Spells that have neglegable material components such as "a feather" can be nullified.
>

<br><br>

### Innate Tekcasting
It is possible for one to cast tek skills without a tekcaster. Synthetic sleeves can have built in tekcasters, however the requirement for a gem as a power source still stands. Humans can also be fitted with a bionic arm that has a built in tekcaster.
