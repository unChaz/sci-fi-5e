#  Scion

The scion gains their ability to use tek skills not from studying the science behind it as an Arcanist would, but from a connection with an ancient alien entity, whether it be through blood, or a chance encounter.

###  Hit Points

**Hit Dice:** 1d6 per scion level

**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 6 + your Constitution Modifier

**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution Modifier per scion level after 1st

###  Proficiencies

**Armor:** None

**Weapons:** ion daggers, scorchers

**Tools:** None

**Saving Throws:** Constitution, Charisma

**Skills:** Choose two from History, Charm, Insight, Intimidation, and Religion

###  Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
* (*a*) a scorcher and 20 clips of ammunition or (*b*) any simple weapon
* a tekcaster
* (*a*) an incursion kit or (*b*) a field survival kit
* Two ion daggers

###  Tekcasting

An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane tek. This font of tek, whatever its origin, fuels your tek skills.

###  Cantrips

At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the scion tek skill list. You learn additional scion cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Scion table.

###  Tek Slots

The Scion table shows how many tek skill slots you have to cast your tek skills of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these scion tek skills, you must expend a slot of the tek skill's level or higher. You regain all expended tek skill slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level tek skill *burning hands* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level tek skill slot available, you can cast *burning hands* using either slot.

```
```

###  Tek Skills Known of 1st Level and Higher

You know two 1st-level tek skills of your choice from the scion tek skill list.

The Tek Skills Known column of the Scion table shows when you learn more scion tek skills of your choice. Each of these tek skills must be of a level for which you have tek skill slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new tek skill of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the scion tek skills you know and replace it with another tek skill from the scion tek skill list, which also must be of a level for which you have tek skill slots.

###  Tekcasting Ability

Charisma + Will is your Tekcasting ability for your scion tek skills, since the power of your tek relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a tek skill refers to your Tekcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a scion tek skill you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Tek save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier + your Will modifier

**Tek attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier + your Will modifier + your Wit modifier

###  Tekcasting Focus

You can use an tekcaster as a Tekcasting focus for your scion tek skills.

##  Scionic Origin

Choose a scionic origin, which describes the source of your innate tek power: Alien Bloodline or Alien Soul, both detailed at the end of the class description.

Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.

##  Font of Tek

At 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of tek within yourself. This wellspring is represented by scion points, which allow you to create a variety of tek effects.

###  Scion Points

You have 2 scion points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Scion Points column of the Scion table. You can never have more scion points than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent scion points when you finish a long rest.

###  Flexible Casting

You can use your scion points to gain additional tek skill slots, or sacrifice tek skill slots to gain additional scion points. You learn other ways to use your scion points as you reach higher levels.

**_Creating Tek Slots._** You can transform unexpended scion points into one tek skill slot as a bonus action on your turn. The Creating Tek Slots table shows the cost of creating a tek skill slot of a given level. You can create tek skill slots no higher in level than 5th.

Any tek skill slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a long rest.

```
```

**Creating Tek Slots (table)**

| Tek Slot Level | Scion Point Cost |
|------------------|--------------------|
| 1st              | 2                  |
| 2nd              | 3                  |
| 3rd              | 5                  |
| 4th              | 6                  |
| 5th              | 7                  |

**_Converting a Tek Slot to Scion Points._** As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one tek skill slot and gain a number of scion points equal to the slot's level.

\page

##  Metatek

At 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your tek skills to suit your needs. You gain two of the following Metatek options of your choice. You gain another one at 10th and 17th level.

You can use only one Metatek option on a tek skill when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.

####  Careful Tek

When you cast a tek skill that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the tek skill's full force. To do so, you spend 1 scion point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the tek skill.

####  Distant Tek

When you cast a tek skill that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 scion point to double the range of the tek skill.

When you cast a tek skill that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 scion point to make the range of the tek skill 30 feet.

####  Empowered Tek

When you roll damage for a tek skill, you can spend 1 scion point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls.

You can use Empowered Tek even if you have already used a different Metatek option during the casting of the tek skill.

####  Extended Tek

When you cast a tek skill that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 scion point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.

#### Heightened Tek

When you cast a tek skill that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 scion points to give one target of the tek skill disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the tek skill.

####  Quickened Tek

When you cast a tek skill that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 scion points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.

####  Subtle Tek

When you cast a tek skill, you can spend 1 scion point to cast it without any somatic or verbal components.



####  Twinned Tek

When you cast a tek skill that targets only one creature and doesn't have a range of self, you can spend a number of scion points equal to the tek skill's level to target a second creature in range with the same tek skill (1 scion point if the tek skill is a cantrip).

To be eligible, a tek skill must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the tek skill's current level. For example, *tek missile* and *scorching ray* aren't eligible, but *ray of frost* and *chromatic orb* are.

##  Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

##  Scionic Restoration

At 20th level, you regain 4 expended scion points whenever you finish a short rest.

##  Scionic Origins

Different scions claim different origins for their innate tek. Although many variations exist, most of these origins fall into two categories: a alien bloodline and chaos tek.

###  Alien Bloodline

Your innate tek comes from alien tek that was mingled with your blood or that of your ancestors. Most often, scions with this origin trace their descent back to an alien of ancient times who parented a child with a human. Any given scion could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a scientific experiment involving alien DNA gone wrong.

####  Alien Ancestor

At 1st level, you choose one type of alien as your ancestor. The damage type associated with each alien is used by features you gain later.

**Alien Ancestry (table)**

| Alien | Damage Type |
|--------|-------------|
| Black  | Acid        |
| Blue   | Shock       |
| Gold   | Fire        |
| Green  | Poison      |
| Red    | Fire        |
| Silver | Cold        |


You can speak, read, and write Alien. Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting with aliens, your proficiency bonus is doubled if it applies to the check.

####  Alien Resilience

As tek flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your alien ancestors to emerge. At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.

Additionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of alien-like carapace. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.

\page

####  Elemental Affinity

Starting at 6th level, when you cast a tek skill that deals damage of the type associated with your alien ancestry, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that tek skill. At the same time, you can spend 1 scion point to gain resistance to that damage type for 1 hour.

####  Natural Levitation

At 14th level, you gain the ability to surround yourself with an alien glowing aura causing you to levitate, gaining a fly speed speed equal to your current speed. You can enable this ability as a bonus action on your turn. It lasts until you dismiss it as a bonus action on your turn.

####  Alien Presence

Beginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread presence of your alien ancestor, causing those around you to become awestruck or frightened. As an action, you can spend 5 scion points to draw on this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration tek skill), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose fear) until the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to your aura for 24 hours.

### Alien Soul

Sometimes the spark of tek that fuels a scion comes directly from a alien soul trapped inside your body.

A Alien Soul, with a natural magnetism, is seen as a threat by some religious hierarchies. As an outsider who commands sacred power, an Alien Soul can undermine an existing order by claiming to act under direct control of an alien entity.

In some cultures, only those who can claim the power of a Alien Soul may command religious power.

#### Alien Magic
Your link to the alien allows you to learn spells from the cleric class. When your Spellcasting feature lets you learn or replace a scion cantrip or a scion spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose the new spell from the cleric spell list or the scion spell list. You must otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting the spell, and it becomes a scion spell for you.

In addition, choose an affinity for the source of your alien power: good, evil, law, chaos, or neutrality. You learn an additional spell based on that affinity, as shown below. It is a scion spell for you, but it doesn’t count against your number of scion spells known. If you later replace this spell, you must replace it with a spell from the cleric spell list.

| Affinity |	Spell |
|--------|-----------|
| Good|	cure wounds|
| Evil|	inflict wounds|
| Law|	bless|
| Chaos|	bane|
| Neutrality|	protection from evil and good|

```
```

##### Chaos
You learn the bane spell, but it doesn’t count against your number of scion spells known. If you later replace this | spell, you must replace it with a spell from the cleric spell list.

##### Evil
You learn the inflict wounds spell, but it doesn’t count against your number of scion spells known. If you later replace this spell, you must replace it with a spell from the cleric spell list.

##### Good
You learn the cure wounds spell, but it doesn’t count against your number of scion spells known. If you later replace this spell, you must replace it with a spell from the cleric spell list.

##### Law
You learn the bless spell, but it doesn’t count against your number of scion spells known. If you later replace this spell, you must replace it with a spell from the cleric spell list.

##### Neutrality
You learn the protection from evil and good spell, but it doesn’t count against your number of scion spells known. If you later replace this spell, you must replace it with a spell from the cleric spell list.

#### Favored by the Gods
Starting at 1st level, alien power guards your destiny. If you fail a saving throw or miss with an attack roll, you can roll 2d4 and add it to the total, possibly changing the outcome. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Empowered Healing
Starting at 6th level, the alien energy coursing through you can empower healing spells. Whenever you or an ally within 5 feet of you rolls dice to determine the number of hit points a spell restores, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll any number of those dice once, provided you aren’t incapacitated. You can use this feature only once per turn.

#### Otherworldly Wings
Starting at 14th level, you can use a bonus action to manifest a pair of spectral wings from your back. While the wings are present, you have a flying speed of 30 feet. The wings last until you’re incapacitated, you die, or you dismiss them as a bonus action.

The affinity you chose for your Alien Magic feature determines the appearance of the spectral wings: eagle wings for good or law, bat wings for evil or chaos, and dragonfly wings for neutrality.

#### Unearthly Recovery
At 18th level, you gain the ability to overcome grievous injuries. As a bonus action when you have fewer than half of your hit points remaining, you can regain a number of hit points equal to half your hit point maximum.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
