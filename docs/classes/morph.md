#  Morph

Morphs are tekcasters who have developed their tekcasting ability to strengthen their bond with nature. What began as a group of conservationists bringing tekcasters back to earth, developed into several cult-like organizations dedicating to unlocking the secrets of nature via tek.

###  Hit Points

**Hit Dice:** 1d8 per morph level

**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution Modifier

**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution Modifier per morph level after 1st

###  Proficiencies

**Armor:** Light armor, medium armor

**Weapons:** ion daggers, scorchers

**Tools:** Botanist's Kit

**Saving Throws:** Intelligence, Wisdom

**Skills:** Choose two from History, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Nature

###  Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

* (*a*) a stun fist (*b*) any simple weapon
* (*a*) an ion blade or (*b*) any simple melee weapon
* Flak armor, a field survival kit, and a morphic focus

###  Morphic cant

You know Morphic, the secret language of morphs. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message's presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can't decipher it without tek.

###  Tekcasting

Drawing on the alien essence of tekcasters, you can cast tek skills to shape the essence of nature to your will.

###  Cantrips

At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the morph tek skill list. You learn additional morph cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Morph table.

```
```

###  Preparing and Casting Tek Skills

The Morph table shows how many tek skill slots you have to cast your tek skills of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these morph tek skills, you must expend a slot of the tek skill's level or higher. You regain all expended tek skill slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of morph tek skills that are available for you to cast, choosing from the morph tek skill list. When you do so, choose a number of morph tek skills equal to your Wisdom modifier + your morph level (minimum of one tek skill). The tek skills must be of a level for which you have tek skill slots.

For example, if you are a 3rd-level morph, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level tek skill slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared tek skills can include six tek skills of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level tek skill *cure wounds,* you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the tek skill doesn't remove it from your list of prepared tek skills.

You can also change your list of prepared tek skills when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of morph tek skills requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per tek skill level for each tek skill on your list.

##  Tekcasting Ability

Wisdom + Will is your Tekcasting ability for your morph tek skills, since your tek draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a tek skill refers to your Tekcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a morph tek skill you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Tek save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**Tek attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

##  Ritual Casting

You can cast a morph tek skill as a ritual if that tek skill has the ritual tag and you have the tek skill prepared.

###  Tekcasting Focus

You can use a tekcaster as a focus for your morph tek skills.

##  Wild Shape

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

Your morph level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed.

**Beast Shapes (table)**

| Level | Max. CR | Limitations                 | Example     |
|-------|---------|-----------------------------|-------------|
| 2nd   | 1/4     | No flying or swimming speed | Wolf        |
| 4th   | 1/2     | No flying speed             | Crocodile   |
| 8th   | 1       | —                           | Giant eagle |

You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your morph level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.

While you are transformed, the following rules apply:

* Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.
* When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.

\page

* You can't cast tek skills, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a tek skill you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a tek skill, such as *call lightning*, that you've already cast.
* You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.
* You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.

##  Morph Circle

Morphs have obtained their tek abilities from Morph Circles; cult like organizations that explore the possibilities of combining tekcasting with nature.

At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of morphs: the Circle of the Land or the Circle of the Moon, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

##  Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

##  Timeless Body

Starting at 18th level, the nature shifting tek that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.

##  Beast Tek Skills

Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your morph tek skills in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a morph tek skill while in a beast shape, but you aren't able to provide material components.

##  Archmorph

At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times.

Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your morph tek skills, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren't consumed by a tek skill. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.

##  Morph Circles

###  Circle of the Land

The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These morphs meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Morphic. The circle's wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your tek is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle's mysterious rites.

####  Bonus Cantrip

When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional morph cantrip of your choice.

####  Natural Recovery

Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your tek energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended tek skill slots to recover. The tek skill slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your morph level
(rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

For example, when you are a 4th-level morph, you can recover up to two levels worth of tek skill slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.

####  Circle Tek Skills

Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain tek skills. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle tek skills connected to the land where you became a morph. Choose that land—arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp—and consult the associated list of tek skills.

Once you gain access to a circle tek skill, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of tek skills you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a tek skill that doesn't appear on the morph tek skill list, the tek skill is nonetheless a morph tek skill for you.

| 9th         | insect plague, scrying               |

####  Land's Stride

Starting at 6th level, moving through nontek difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nontek plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the *entangle* tek skill.

####  Nature's Ward

When you reach 10th level, you can't be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease.

####  Nature's Sanctuary

When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your morph tek skill save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.

The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you.

> ##  Sacred Plants and Wood
>
> A morph holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Morphs often use such plants as part of a Tekcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.
>
> Similarly, a morph uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and pulse shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for Ion Blades or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or Bowstaffs, as well as pulse shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or ion daggers.
>
> Morphs from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a morph of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.
