# Scout
Modern scouts are very different from those of the past. Today scouts must be versatile enough to track a quarry within the metal hulls of spacecraft or space stations, and in the many types of environment found planet-side on the many habitable planets and moons. Scouts specialize in ranged and martial combat, and employ the use of tekcasting to enhance their combat viability.

### Tek Slots

The Scout table shows how many tek skill slots you have to cast your tek skills of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these tek skills, you must expend a slot of the tek skill's level or higher. You regain all expended tek skill slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level tek skill *animal friendship* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level tek skill slot available, you can cast *animal friendship* using either slot.

#### Tek Skills Known of 1st Level and Higher

You know two 1st-level tek skills of your choice from the scout tek skill list.

The Tek Skills Known column of the Scout table shows when you learn more scout tek skills of your choice. Each of these tek skills must be of a level for which you have tek skill slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new tek skill of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the scout tek skills you know and replace it with another tek skill from the scout tek skill list, which also must be of a level for which you have tek skill slots.

```
```

### Tekcasting Ability

Wisdom + Will is your Tekcasting ability for your scout tek skills, since your tek draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a tek skill refers to your Tekcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a scout tek skill you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Tek save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**Tek attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

### Scout Archetype

At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate: Hunter or Beast Master, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.

\page

### Scout Drone

Beginning at 3rd level, you can deploy a Scout Drone that lasts 10 minutes. It is spherical in shape, about 1 inch in diameter. It gets +5 to Stealth checks. As an action you can give the drone movement instructions through your datapad. As a bonus action you can view the drone's' camera and microphone feed through your datapad. After 10 minutes, the drone's battery dies, and unless in null-g, it falls to the ground. If the drone is destroyed, you must spend a long rest in order to repair it. Otherwise it becomes fully charged at the end of a short rest.

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Spacer Agility

Starting at 8th level, you take no movement penalty for moving in null gravity.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against objects that are created or manipulated to impede movement.

### Improved Scout Drone

Starting at 10th level, your scouting drone lasts 1 hour, and can be repaired over a short rest, and is cloaked, requiring a DC 15 Perception check to be seen.

### Vanish

Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can't be tracked by nontek means, unless you choose to leave a trail.

### Keen Senses

At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can't see. When you attack a creature you can't see, your inability to see it doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.

You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't blinded or deafened.

### Foe Slayer

At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.

```
```

## Scout Archetypes

The ideal of the scout has three classic expressions: the Sharpshooter, Ranger, and Ghost.

### Sharpshooter

#### Sniper's Target

At 3rd level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

**_Assassin._** Your tenacity can wear down the most potent foes. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage if it's below its hit point maximum. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn.

**_Giant Killer._** When a Large or larger creature within 5 feet of you hits or misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to attack that creature immediately after its attack, provided that you can see the creature.

**_Horde Breaker._** Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target and within range of your weapon.

#### Defensive Tactics

At 7th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

**_Escape the Horde._** Opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage.

**_Multiattack Defense._** When a creature hits you with an attack, you gain a +4 bonus to AC against all subsequent attacks made by that creature for the rest of the turn.

**_Steel Will._** You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.

#### Multiattack

At 11th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

**_Volley._** You can use your action to make a ranged attack against any number of creatures within 10 feet of a point you can see within your weapon's range. You must have ammunition for each target, as normal, and you make a separate attack roll for each target.

**_Whirlwind Attack._** You can use your action to make a melee attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each target.

#### Superior Defense

At 15th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

**_Evasion._** When you are subjected to an effect, such as *lightning bolt* tek skill, that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

**_Stand Against the Tide._** When a hostile creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to repeat the same attack against another creature (other than itself) of your choice.

**_Uncanny Dodge._** When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.

\page

### Ranger

You are skilled in stealth and surviving far from the streets of a city, allowing you to scout ahead of your companions during expeditions. Scouts who embrace this archetype are at home in the wilderness and among brutes and scoundrels, and many Rangers serve as the eyes and ears of military squads. Ambusher, spy, bounty hunter — these are just a few of the roles that Rangers assume as they range the world.

#### Skirmisher
Starting at 3rd level, you are difficult to pin down during a fight. You can move up to half your speed as a reaction when an enemy ends its turn within 5 feet of you. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

#### Survivalist

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Science and Survival skills if you don't already have it. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of those proficiencies.

#### Superior Mobility
At 9th level, your walking speed increases by 10 feet. If you have a climbing or swimming speed, this increase applies to that speed as well.

#### Ambush Master

Starting at 13th level, you excel at leading ambushes and acting first in a fight.

You have advantage on initiative rolls. In addition, the first creature you hit during the first round of a combat becomes easier for you and others to strike; attack rolls against that target have advantage until the start of your next turn.

#### Sudden Strike

Starting at 17th level, you can strike with deadly speed. If you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make one additional attack as a bonus action. This attack also triggers your Extra Attack feature.

```
```

### Ghost

Ghosts specialize in stalking through the shadows

#### Ghost Magic
Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Ghost Tek Skills table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of scout tek skills you know.

#### Ghost Tek Skills

| Scout Level | Spell |
|------------------|--------------------|
| 3rd  | disguise self |
| 5th  | rope trick |
| 9th  | fear |
| 13th  | greater invisibility
| 17th  | seeming |


#### Ambusher

At 3rd level, you master the art of the ambush. You can give yourself a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Wisdom modifier.

At the start of your first turn of each combat, your walking speed increases by 10 feet, which lasts until the end of that turn. If you take the Attack action on that turn, you can make one additional weapon attack as part of that action. If that attack hits, the target takes an extra 1d8 damage of the weapon's damage type.

#### Spectral Sight

At 3rd level, you have obtained specter goggles. You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision from your race, its range increases by 30 feet.

You are also adept at evading creatures that rely on darkvision. While in darkness, you are invisible to any creature that relies on darkvision to see you in that darkness.

#### Iron Mind

By 7th level, you have honed your ability to resist the mind-altering powers of your prey. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency in Intelligence or Charisma saving throws (your choice).

#### Stalker's Flurry
At 11th level, you learn to attack with such unexpected speed that you can turn a miss into another strike. Once on each of your turns when you miss with a weapon attack, you can make another weapon attack as part of the same action.

#### Shadowy Dodge
Starting at 15th level, you can dodge in unforeseen ways, with wisps of supernatural shadow around you. Whenever a creature makes an attack roll against you and doesn't have advantage on the roll, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on it. You must use this feature before you know the outcome of the attack roll.
