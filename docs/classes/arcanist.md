# Arcanist

The Arcanist is a scholar who has studied the nuanced science of tekcasting, also known as the Arcane Arts.

### Hit Points

**Hit Dice:** 1d6 per Arcanist level

**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 6 + your Constitution Modifier

**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution Modifier per Arcanist level after 1st

### Proficiencies

**Armor:** None

**Weapons:** ion daggers, darts, slings, bowstaffs, scorchers

**Tools:** None

**Saving Throws:** Intelligence, Wisdom

**Skills:** Choose two from Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine

### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
* *(a)* a Bowstaff or (*b*) an ion dagger
* *(a)* a component pouch or (*b*) an tekcaster
* *(a)* a scholar's pack or (*b*) a field survival kit
* A datapad

### Tekcasting

As a student of arcane tek, you have a tek skill datapad containing tek skills that show the first glimmerings of your true power.

### Cantrips

At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the Arcanist tek skill list. You learn additional Arcanist cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Arcanist table.

### Tek Datapad

At 1st level, you have a tek skill datapad containing six 1st- level Arcanist tek skills of your choice. Your tek skill datapad is the repository of the Arcanist tek skills you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.


### Preparing and Casting Tek Skills

The Arcanist table shows how many tek skill slots you have to cast your tek skills of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these tek skills, you must expend a slot of the tek skill's level or higher. You regain all expended tek skill slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of Arcanist tek skills that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of Arcanist tek skills from your tek skill datapad equal to your Intelligence modifier + your Arcanist level (minimum of one tek skill). The tek skills must be of a level for which you have tek skill slots.

You can change your list of prepared tek skills when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of Arcanist tek skills requires time spent studying your tek skill datapad and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the tek skill: at least 1 minute per tek skill level for each tek skill on your list.

### Tekcasting Ability

Intelligence + Will is your Tekcasting ability for your Arcanist tek skills, since you learn your tek skills through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a tek skill refers to your Tekcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an arcanist tek skill you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Tek save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier + your Will modifier

**Tek attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier + your Will modifier

### Ritual Casting

You can cast an arcanist tek skill as a ritual if that tek skill has the ritual tag and you have the tek skill in your tek skill datapad. You don't need to have the tek skill prepared.

### Tekcasting Focus

You can use an tekcaster as a Tekcasting focus for your Arcanist tek skills.

#### Learning Tek Skills of 1st Level and Higher

Each time you gain an arcanist level, you can add two Arcanist tek skills of your choice to your tek skill datapad for free. Each of these tek skills must be of a level for which you have tek skill slots, as shown on the Arcanist table. On your adventures, you might find other tek skills that you can add to your tek skill datapad (see the “Your tek skill datapad” sidebar).

### Arcane Recovery

You have learned to regain some of your tek energy by studying your tek skill datapad. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended tek skill slots to recover. The tek skill slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your Arcanist level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.

For example, if you're a 4th-level Arcanist, you can recover up to two levels worth of tek skill slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level tek skill slot or two 1st-level tek skill slots.

### Arcane Tradition

When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of tek through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation, all detailed at the end of the class description.

Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Tek Mastery

At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain tek skills that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level Arcanist tek skill and a 2nd-level Arcanist tek skill that are in your tek skill datapad. You can cast those tek skills at their lowest level without expending a tek skill slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either tek skill at a higher level, you must expend a tek skill slot as normal.

By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the tek skills you chose for different tek skills of the same levels.

### Signature Tek Skills

When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful tek skills and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level Arcanist tek skills in your tek skill datapad as your signature tek skills. You always have these tek skills prepared, they don't count against the number of tek skills you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a tek skill slot. When you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

If you want to cast either tek skill at a higher level, you must expend a tek skill slot as normal.

## Arcane Traditions

The study of the arcane arts began with the discoveries of tek.

The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of tek. Arcanists through the centuries have cataloged thousands of tek skills, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools; an arcanist might study at the School of Illusion while another studies across town at the School of Enchantment. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even Arcanists who train apprentices in the solitude of their own apartments use the division of tek into schools as a learning device, since the tek skills of each school require mastery of different techniques.

## School of Evocation

You focus your study on tek that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling concussive, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as pirates, explorers, or aspiring tyrants.

### Evocation Savant

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the credits and time you must spend to copy an evocation tek skill into your tek skill datapad is halved.

### Sculpt Tek Skills

Beginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocation tek skills. When you cast an evocation tek skill that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the tek skill's level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the tek skill, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.

### Potent Cantrip

Starting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip's damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.

### Empowered Evocation

Beginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of any Arcanist evocation tek skill you cast.

### Overchannel

Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler tek skills. When you cast an arcanist tek skill of 1st through 5th level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that tek skill.

The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 radiation damage for each level of the tek skill, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the radiation damage per tek skill level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.

> ## Your tek skill datapad
>
> Arcanists use a datapad to compile all of the knowledge of the arcane arts.
>
> The tek skills that you add to your tek skill datapad as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other tek skills during your adventures. You could discover a tek skill recorded on a datacube in an evil Arcanist's chest, for example, or in a dusty disk in an ancient library.
>
> **_Copying a Tek into the Datapad._** When you find an arcanist tek skill of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your tek skill datapad if it is of a tek skill level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.
>
> Copying that tek skill into your tek skill datapad involves reproducing the basic form of the tek skill, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the Arcanist who wrote it. You must practice the tek skill until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then type it into your tek skill datapad using your own notation. If the tek skill is in the form of digital data, it can simply be scanned into your datapad, but you must still spend time to learn how to use it.
>
> For each level of the tek skill, the process takes 2 hours and costs 5000 credits.

## School of Artifice

### Infuse Item

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to imbue mundane items with certain magical infusions. The magic items you create with this feature are effectively prototypes of permanent items.

#### Infusions Known

When you gain this feature, pick four artificer infusions to learn, choosing from the “Artificer Infusions” section at the end of the class’s description. You learn additional infusions of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Infusions Known column of the Artificer table.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer infusions you learned with a new one.

#### Infusing an Item

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a non-magical object and imbue it with one of your artificer infusions, turning it into a magic item. An infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as specified in the infusion’s description. If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement (see “Attunement” in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide).

Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the infusion vanishes after a number of days have passed equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day). The infusion also vanishes if you give up your knowledge of the infusion for another one.

You can infuse more than one nonmagical object at the end of a long rest; the maximum number of objects appears in the Infused Items column of the Artificer table. You must touch each of the objects, and each of your infusions can be in only one object at a time. Moreover, no object can bear more than one of your infusions at a time. If you try to exceed your maximum number of infusions, the oldest infusion immediately ends, and then the new infusion applies.

If an infusion ends on an item that contains other things, like a bag of holding, its contents harmlessly appear in and around its space.

### Artificer Specialist
At 3rd level, you choose the type of specialist you are: Alchemist, Artillerist, or Battle Smith, each of which is detailed at the end of the class’s description. Your choice grants you features at 5th level and again at 9th and 15th level.

### Flash of Genius
Starting at 6th level, you gain the ability to come up with solutions under pressure. When you or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an ability check or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to add your Intelligence modifier to the roll.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Magic Item Adept
When you reach 10th level, you achieve a profound understanding of how to use and make magic items:

You can attune to up to four magic items at once.
If you craft a magic item with a rarity of common or uncommon, it takes you a quarter of the normal time, and it costs you half as much of the usual gold.

### Magic Item Savant
At 14th level, your skill with magic items deepens more:

You can attune to up to five magic items at once.
You ignore all class, race, spell, and level requirements on attuning to or using a magic item.

### Magic Item Master
Starting at 18th level, you can attune to up to six magic items at once.

### Soul of Artifice
At 20th level, you develop a mystical connection to your magic items, which you can draw on for protection:

You gain a +1 bonus to all saving throws per magic item you are currently attuned to.
If you’re reduced to 0 hit points but not killed out-right, you can use your reaction to end one of your artificer infusions, causing you to drop to 1 hit point instead of 0.

### Artificer Infusions
Artificers have invented numerous magical infusions, extraordinary processes that rapidly create magic items. To many, artificers seem like wonderworkers, accomplishing in hours what others need weeks to complete.

The description of each of the following infusions details the type of item that can receive it, along with whether the resulting magic item requires attunement.

Some infusions specify a minimum artificer level. You can’t learn such an infusion until you are at least that level.

Unless an infusion’s description says otherwise, you can’t learn an infusion more than once.

### Boots of the Winding Path
Prerequisite: 6th-level artificer
Item: A pair of boots (requires attunement)

While wearing these boots, a creature can teleport up to 15 feet as a bonus action to an unoccupied space the creature can see. The creature must have occupied that space at some point during the current turn.

### Enhanced Tekcaster
Item: A tekcaster (Requires attunement)

While holding this tekcaster, a creature gains a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls. In addition, the creature ignores half cover when making a spell attack.

The bonus increases to +2 when you reach 10th level in this class.

### Enhanced Defense
Item: A suit of armor or a shield

A creature gains a +1 bonus to Armor Class while wearing (armor) or wielding (shield) the infused item.

The bonus increases to +2 when you reach 10th level in this class.

### Enhanced Weapon
Item: A simple or martial weapon

This magic weapon grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

The bonus increases to +2 when you reach 10th level in this class.

### Homunculus Servant
Item: A gem worth at least 10,000 credits.

You learn intricate methods for creating a special homunculus that serves you. The item you infuse serves as the device's heart, around which the creature’s body instantly forms.

You determine the homunculus’s appearance. Some artificers prefer mechanical-looking birds, whereas some like winged vials or miniature, animate cauldrons.

The homunculus is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See this device’s game statistics in the Homunculus Servant stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places.

In combat, the homunculus shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the homunculus can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.

The homunculus regains 2d6 hit points if the mending spell is cast on it. If it dies, it vanishes, leaving its heart in its space. If you or the homunculus dies, it vanishes, leaving its heart in its space.

### HOMUNCULUS SERVANT
_Tiny construct_

**Armor Class** 13 (natural armor)

**Hit Points** 1 + your Intelligence modifier + your artificer level (the homunculus has a number of Hit Dice [d4s] equal to your artificer level)

**Speed** 20 ft., fly 30 ft.

STR 4 (−3)
DEX 15 (+2)
CON 12 (+1)
INT 10 (+0)
WIS 10 (+0)
CHA 7 (−2)

Saving Throws Dex +2 plus PB

Damage Immunities poison

Condition Immunities exhaustion, poisoned

Senses darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 10 + (PB × 2)

Languages understands the languages you speak

Challenge — Proficiency Bonus (PB) equals your bonus

**Evasion**. If the homunculus is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails. It can’t use this trait if it’s incapacitated.

#### Actions

**Force Strike**. Ranged Weapon Attack: your spell attack modifier to hit, range 30 ft., one target you can see. Hit: 1d4 + PB force damage.

#### Reactions

**Channel Magic**. The homunculus delivers a spell you cast that has a range of touch. The homunculus must be within 120 feet of you.

### Repeating Shot

Item: A simple or martial weapon with the ammunition property (requires attunement)

This magic weapon grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it when it’s used to make a ranged attack, and it ignores the loading property if it has it.

If you load no ammunition in the weapon, it produces its own, automatically creating one piece of magic ammunition when you make a ranged attack with it. The ammunition created by the weapon vanishes the instant after it hits or misses a target.

### Returning Weapon

Item: A simple or martial weapon with the thrown property

This magic weapon grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it, and it returns to the wielder’s hand immediately after it is used to make a ranged attack.
