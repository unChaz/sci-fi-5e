# Evangelist

Evangelists are the celebrities and influencers of the SIGNET. They have gained notoriety and influence among the populus, and they have used that influence to their advantage including the ability to use a tekcaster.

**Saving Throws:** Dexterity, Charisma

**Skills:** Choose any three

### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

* (*a*) an ion blade, (*b*) a pulse blade, or (*c*) any simple weapon
* (*a*) a diplomat's pack or (*b*) an entertainer's pack
* (*a*) a ukulele or (*b*) any other musical instrument
* scarab skin and an ion dagger

### Tekcasting

You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in harmony with your wishes and music.

Your tek skills are part of your vast repertoire, tek that you can tune to different situations.

#### Cantrips

You know two cantrips of your choice from the evangelist tek skill list. You learn additional evangelist cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Evangelist table.

#### Tek Slots

The Evangelist table shows how many tek skill slots you have to cast your tek skills of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these tek skills, you must expend a slot of the tek skill's level or higher. You regain all expended tek skill slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level tek skill *cure wounds* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level tek skill slot available, you can cast *cure wounds* using either slot.

##### Tek Skills Known of 1st Level and Higher

You know four 1st-level tek skills of your choice from the evangelist tek skill list.

The Tek Skills Known column of the Evangelist table shows when you learn more evangelist tek skills of your choice. Each of these tek skills must be of a level for which you have tek skill slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new tek skill of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the evangelist tek skills you know and replace it with another tek skill from the evangelist tek skill list, which also must be of a level for which you have tek skill slots.

#### Tekcasting Ability

Charisma + Wit is your Tekcasting ability for your evangelist tek skills. Your tek comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a tek skill refers to your Tekcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a evangelist tek skill you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Tek save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier + your Will modifier + your Wit modifier

**Tek attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier + your Wit modifier

##### Ritual Casting

You can cast any evangelist tek skill you know as a ritual if that tek skill has the ritual tag.

##### Tekcasting Focus

You can use a tek integrated musical instrument (see chapter 5, “Equip-ment”) as a Tekcasting focus for your evangelist tek skills.

#### Evangelistic Inspiration

You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Evangelistic Inspiration die, a d6.

Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Evangelistic Inspiration die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Evangelistic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Evangelistic Inspiration die at a time.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Your Evangelistic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.

</div>

### Popularity Contest

Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus.

### Song of Rest

Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.

The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.

### Evangelist College

At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a evangelist college of your choice.

Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level.

```
```

### Expertise

At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.

At 10th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this benefit.

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Font of Inspiration

Beginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Evangelistic Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest.

\page

#### Countercharm

At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).

#### Tek Secrets

By 10th level, you have plundered tek knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines. Choose two tek skills from any class, including this one. A tek skill you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Evangelist table, or a cantrip.

The chosen tek skills count as evangelist tek skills for you and are included in the number in the Tek Skills Known column of the Evangelist table.

You learn two additional tek skills from any class at 14th level and again at 18th level.

### Superior Inspiration

At 20th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Evangelistic Inspiration left, you regain one use.

## Evangelist Colleges

### College of Journalism

Journalists are always out to get the big scoop. Whether it's to witness and document a big discovery, expose the corruption of a polititian, or simply to document the life of a spacer, Journalists always have the camera running.

The loyalty of these evangelists lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a corporation or government.

Some Journalists work freelance, while others may report to a specific news site on the web.

#### Bonus Proficiencies

When you join the College of Lore at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with three skills of your choice.


#### Cutting Words

Also at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of Evangelistic Inspiration, rolling a Evangelistic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature's roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the GM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage. The creature is immune if it can't hear you or if it's immune to being charmed.

#### Additional Tek Secrets

At 6th level, you learn two tek skills of your choice from any class. A tek skill you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Evangelist table, or a cantrip. The chosen tek skills count as evangelist tek skills for you but don't count against the number of evangelist tek skills you know.

#### Peerless Knowledge

Starting at 14th level, when you make an ability check, you can expend one use of Evangelistic Inspiration. Roll a Evangelistic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your ability check. You can choose to do so after you roll the die for the ability check, but before the GM tells you whether you succeed or fail.

### College of Seminary

Priests of any religion attend university to obtain their education. Many religions completely shun the use of tekcasters, but a very few new age religions allow and even encourage the use of tek skills. These religious organizations will often equip their priests with tekcasters and send them out to spread the word, or to do jobs for the church.

#### Bonus Cantrips and Spells

When you join the College of Seminary, you gain access to the cantrips and spells from the Priest table.

#### Channel Divinity

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel Alien energy directly from your tekcaster. 

When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.

Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your priest tek skill save DC.

Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.

#### Channel Divinity: Turn Undead
Starting at 3rd level, as an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

#### Channel Divinity: Preserve Life

Starting at 3rd level, you can  heal the badly injured.

As an action, you use your tekcaster to evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your Evangelist level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can't use this feature on an undead or a construct.

#### Blessed Healer

Beginning at 6th level, the healing tek skills you cast on others heal you as well. When you cast a tek skill of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the tek skill's level.

#### Tek Strike

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with tek energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 kinetic damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

#### Supreme Healing

Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a tek skill, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12.
