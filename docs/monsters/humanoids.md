# Humans
## Non-Player Characters

---

This appendix contains statistics for various humanoid non-player characters (NPCs) that adventurers might encounter during a campaign, including lowly commoners and mighty archmages. These stat blocks can be used to represent both human and nonhuman NPCs.

### Customizing NPCs

There are many easy ways to customize the NPCs in this appendix for your home campaign.

**_Racial Traits_**. You can add racial traits to an NPC. For example, a halfling morph might have a speed of 25 feet and the Lucky trait. Adding racial traits to an NPC doesn't alter its challenge rating. For more on racial traits, see the _Player's Handbook_.

**_Tek Swaps_**. One way to customize an NPC tekcaster is to replace one or more of its tek skills. You can substitute any tek skill on the NPC's tek skill list with a different tek skill of the same level from the same tek skill list. Swapping tek skills in this manner doesn't alter an NPC's challenge rating.

**_Armor and Weapon Swaps_**. You can upgrade or downgrade an NPC's armor, or add or switch weapons. Adjustments to Armor Class and damage can change an NPC's challenge rating.

**_Alien Artifacts_**. The more powerful an NPC, the more likely it has one or more alien artifacts in its possession. An archmage, for example, might have a tek staff or wand, as well as one or more potions and datacubes. Giving an NPC a potent damage-dealing alien artifact could alter its challenge rating.

**Space Pirates** rove in gangs and are sometimes led by thugs, veterans, or tekcasters. Not all Space Pirates are evil. Oppression, drought, disease, or famine can often drive otherwise honest folk to a life of Space Piracy.

### Space Pirate Captain

_Medium humanoid (any race), any non-lawful alignment_

**Armor Class** 15 (flak armor)

**Hit Points** 65 (10d8 + 20)

**_scorcher_**. _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +3 to hit, range 80 ft./320 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 5 (1d8 + 1) piercing damage.

**Reactions**

**_Parry_**. The captain adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the captain must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.

It takes a strong personality, ruthless cunning, and a silver tongue to keep a gang of Space Pirates in line. The **Space Pirate captain** has these qualities in spades.

In addition to managing a crew of selfish malcontents, the **pirate captain** is a variation of the Space Pirate captain, with a ship to protect and command. To keep the crew in line, the captain must mete out rewards and punishment on a regular basis.

More than loot, a Space Pirate captain or pirate captain craves infamy. A prisoner who appeals to the captain's vanity or ego is more likely to be treated fairly than a prisoner who does not or claims not to know anything of the captain's colorful reputation.

**Skills** History +3, Charm +4, Perception +4, Stealth +3

**Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 14

**Languages** Common, Alien, Sylvan

**Challenge** 3 (700 XP)

**_Amphibious_**. The hag can breathe air and water.

**_Innate Tekcasting_**. The hag's innate Tekcasting ability is Charisma (tek skill save DC 12). She can innately cast the following tek skills, requiring no material components:

At will: _dancing lights_, _minor illusion_, _vicious mockery_

**_Mimicry_**. The hag can mimic animal sounds and humanoid voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check.

**Actions**

**_Claws_**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.

**_Illusory Appearance_**. The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a tek illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.

The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have smooth skin, but someone touching her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.

**_Invisible Passage_**. The hag turns invisible until she attacks or casts a tek skill, or until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a tek skill). While invisible, she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can be tracked only by tek. Any equipment she wears or carries is invisible with her.

### Night Hag

**Hit Points** 112 (15d8 + 45)

2/day each: _plane shift_ (self only), _ray of enfeeblement_, _sleep_

**_Etherealness_**. The hag enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. To do so, the hag must have a _heartstone_ in her possession.

\page

**_Nightmare Haunting (1/Day)_**. While on the Ethereal Plane, the hag touches a sleeping humanoid on the Material Plane. A _protection from evil and good_ tek skill cast on the target prevents this contact, as does a _tek circle_. As long as the contact persists, the target has dreadful visions. If these visions last for at least 1 hour, the target gains no benefit from its rest, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). If this effect reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and if the target was evil, its soul is trapped in the hag's _soul bag_. The reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until removed by the _greater restoration_ tek skill or similar tek.

**Challenge** 2 (450 XP)

**_Amphibious_**. The hag can breathe air and water.

**_Horrific Appearance_**. Any humanoid that starts its turn within 30 feet of the hag and can see the hag's true form must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the hag is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag's Horrific Appearance for the next 24 hours.

Unless the target is surprised or the revelation of the hag's true form is sudden, the target can avert its eyes and avoid making the initial saving throw. Until the start of its next turn, a creature that averts its eyes has disadvantage on attack rolls against the hag.

**Actions**

**_Claws_**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.

**_Death Glare_**. The hag targets one frightened creature she can see within 30 feet of her. If the target can see the hag, it must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw against this tek or drop to 0 hit points.

**_Illusory Appearance_**. The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a tek illusion that makes her look like an ugly creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The effect ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.

The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have no claws, but someone touching her hand might feel the claws. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.
