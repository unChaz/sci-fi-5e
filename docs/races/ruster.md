## Ruster
Rusters are most commonly of Irish descent who worked the Helium3 mines deep under Mars, or of Russian descent from the shipyards of the Galilean moons. They are a small scrappy bunch. They value family, community and freedom above all else. The Rusters have been forced into hard labor for centuries. The few who are lucky enough to escape the mines usually end up as mechanics, or construction workers. Many are forced into a life of crime, as it is nearly impossible for an unmistakable Ruster to climb the rungs of the Martian/Galilean socioeconomic ladder.
