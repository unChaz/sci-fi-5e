## Traveler

Travelers are a small nomadic species originating from Krevilla before the fall. Travelers are scavengers that rely on existing technology to get by. They do not often travel between worlds, but when they do, their ships are usually flotillas jerry-rigged from multiple spacecraft, and move at a crawl. Most Travelers encountered in space are traders and explorers. Planetside Travelers are found in small tribes living off the junkyards of men.
