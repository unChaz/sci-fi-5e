## Bionic

Some humans go the way of bionic enhancement. That is installing computer hardware to enhance their sleeve. You can't be born Bionic, only made that way.

#### Sleeve Origin
Bionic sleeves were all born, or cloned. Your stack trait increase, sleeve trait increase, and overall appearance are inherited from your base race. All other features are replaced with the following features.

#### Additional Trait Increase
Whether by data upload to your stack, or bionic enhancement to your sleeve, you gain 1 additional trait increase.

#### Upgrades
Your sleeve has been upgraded, and although you look the same, subtle enhancements have been made. Choose one:

- Darkvision: Your eyes have been replaced with bionic eyes. You have 60 feet of darkvision.
- Digital Interface: You can interface directly with computers through connectors on your head. Interacting with computers takes a bonus action instead of an action.
- Titanium Arm: You arm has been replaced with a mechanical arm. It appears and feels like a normal arm, but it is resistant to being damaged, and you gain advantage to strength (athletics) checks when using that arm.
- Integrated Tekcaster: A tekcaster has been integrated into your hand. A hidden compartment in your wrist holds the gemstones. It is not noticeable to the naked eye.
