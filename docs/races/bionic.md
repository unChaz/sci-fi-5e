## Bionic

Some humans go the way of bionic enhancement. That is installing computer hardware to enhance their Skin. You can't be born Bionic, only made that way.

#### Skin Origin
Bionic Skins were all born, or cloned. Your EGO trait increase, Skin trait increase, and overall appearance are inherited from your base race. All other features are replaced with the following features.

#### Additional Trait Increase
Whether by data upload to your EGO, or bionic enhancement to your Skin, you gain 1 additional trait increase.

#### Upgrades
Your Skin has been upgraded, and although you look the same, subtle enhancements have been made. Choose one:

- Darkvision: Your eyes have been replaced with bionic eyes. You have 60 feet of darkvision, you can detect heat signatures, and you can design your own software to intigrate with your bionic eyes such as facial recognition, or target tracking (at the DMs discression).
- Digital Interface: You can interface directly with computers through connectors on your head. Interacting with computers takes a bonus action instead of an action.
- Titanium Arm: You arm has been replaced with a mechanical arm. It appears and feels like a normal arm, but it is resistant to being damaged, and you gain advantage to strength (athletics) checks when using that arm, and you gain a +1 to attack/damage roles with any weapon using that arm.
- Robotic Legs: Your legs have been replaced with super strong mechanical legs. Your movement speed and jump distance have doubled, and your legs have built in mag-boots that can be activated with a bonus action, and deactivated at-will.
- Integrated Tekcaster: A tekcaster has been integrated into your hand. A hidden compartment in your wrist holds the gemstones. It is not noticeable to the naked eye.
