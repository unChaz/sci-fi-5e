## Orc

Orcs are an alien species originating from the Prothean ship. They were named orcs due to their resemblance to the mythical creatures of Tolkien lore. They are big and blue skinned, pointy ears, and their hair is stark white. It is believed that the Orcs were a pre-industrial species before they were taken captive by the Protheans. When they colonized the worlds they defaulted to low-tech tribal culture. They use weapons they scavenge or steal. Very few learn to pilot spacecraft into the heavens, but those that do are usually pirates lurking the belt, or ungoverned space. Orcs that have assimilated themselves into human culture have adopted the practice of using EGO technology.
