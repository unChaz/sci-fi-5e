# The Cryo-Emergent Handbook

## Introduction

Welcome to your new life! The Sol Commerce Authority (SCA) is responsible for reorienting all preserved Natural Humans into this new world.

Centuries ago it was common practice for terminally ill humans, or those with vast resources to facilitate the cryogenic preservation of their bodies to be revived when scientific advancement allowed.

SCA legislation HL-3404-C53 dictates that all cryogenically preserved pre-stack natural humans that have not been revived to be confiscated by the SCA. Your consciousness has been legally conscripted into indentured servitude to the SCA until you have paid off your contract.

You were not revived for one of the following reasons:

- Your sleeve was damaged and unsuitable to be revived.
- Your cryo insurance coverage was not comprehensive enough to cover the cost of sleeve repair.
- Your cryo insurance agency was waiting for your sleeve repair costs to become lower.
- The contract on your revival designated a date after HL-3404-C53 went into effect.

## Persona
SCA assesses each emergent, and determines a score for each of the four primary conscious assessment ability scores as determined by the Ganymede Institute of Psychology.

| Ability Score | Description|
|:----:|:-------------|
| Wit  | Mental sharpness and inventiveness; keen intelligence. |
| Fortitude | Courage in pain or adversity. This is the mind's ability to resist tek effects, and mental stress. |
| Intelligence | The ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills. |
| Wisdom | The soundness of an action or decision with regard to the application of experience, knowledge, and good judgment. |

> ### Calculating Ability Scores
> Each ability score is calculated by rolling 4d6, dropping the lowest, subtract 10, and divide by 2 rounding up. This simplifies ability scores to a single number instead of a modifier and a score that is never used. During ability score improvements, instead of getting +1 to two ability scores, you get +1 to a single score.

### Stack

Each human is given a "stack" that is installed at the base of the neck connected to your spinal cord. The Stack contains a complete record of your conscious mind. In the event of your death you can obtain a new body. Additionally, traveling across the solar system has never been faster with the ability to stream your stack backup to a different body. If you have the funds, you can even have a cloned body ready for you on the other side.

If your stack is destroyed however, there is no bringing you back. That is called "true death". The punishment for murder has been lessened with the exception of those who have religious encoding specifying they do not wish to be spun back up.

Having two copies or more of the same stack is illegal, and punishable by the true death of all copies.

It is also possible to enter into a totally virtual environment via the stack. Using this method we can spin up a virtual instance of a person in VR to question them about thier death, or keep prisoners inside a virtual environment indefinitely.

## Sleeve

A "sleeve" is what the transhuman body is now referred to. Upon death, if your stack is recovered, you can purchase a new sleeve, or be provided one in the case of wrongful death, or if you are properly insured.

### Quality Control
All sleeves must be appraised by the **Board of Quality Control** to ensure buyer protection. Sleeves are appraised with the following ability scores.


| Ability Score | Description |
|:----:|:-------------|
|Strength |Physical strength |
|Dexterity | Agility, reflex, and balance |
|Physique | Beauty, appearance |
|Constitution | Overall health |
