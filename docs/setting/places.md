# The Core

## Earth
The home of the Terran is now part sprawling megalopolis, and preserved wilderness. Entire continents are covered in the remnants of the civilization that was destroyed in the Fall, now overgrown by wilderness. A megatropolis spans from what once was western europe to japan. Formerly Africa, Australia, and the Americas are now preserved wilderness with the exception of some pockets of civilization that are thoroughly separated from the nature preserve, only accessible by air.

### Luna
Earth’s moon Luna has long since been terraformed. It has been the capital of the Solar system since the dawn of The Society. Its many layers of city cover the moon with pockets of forests and lakes.

## Mars
The population density of Mars is comparable to that of Earth in the 20th century. Large overpopulated cities, but sprawling wilderness of forests, plains, deserts, and sea. Mars’ primary exports are Helium3 and soldiers.

### Phobos

##Venus
The skies of Venus were colonized long ago with massive floating cities that float on the thick gas. The lower pressure on the insides of the city spheres gives them buoyancy to float in the clouds. The industry of venus is valuable gas it harvests from the surface. Venus has a booming tourist industry, as the planet boasts beautiful views that mix the beautiful venusian horizon with tropical Earth ambience inside the safety of the city sphere.

# The Belt

## Krelavilla

## Ceres

## Eros

# The Rim

## Jupiter

#### Thebe
The smallest of the colonized Jovian moons is the largest shipyard in the system that produces ships for Sun Industries.

## Galilean Moons

### Ganymede
The largest of the Galilean moons, Ganymede was once the capital of the rim. It's temperate climate and low gravity made for an easy place to build. Its cities were built 10 times taller than that which is possible on earth. The surface of Ganymede is over 50% saltwater ocean. Two-thirds of the surface of Ganymede is very rocky. The rest is dark and cratered due to a history collisions with other Jovian satellites. Plantlife on the moon consists mainly of mountainous alpine forests reminiscent of the Swiss Alps.

#### The Twin Cities
The two cities of Achelous and Gula make the single largest metropolitan area in the rim, and the capital of commerce. Each city was once run by an independent mafia organization, but in recent years following a time of turmoil, the two organizations have united. The lines between the cities blurred together long ago, but residents will be sure to let you know where they are from.

##### Achelous
The city of Achelous is built around the crater of the same name-- a 40km wide crater that is now a freshwater lake. The city encircles the entire lake which serves as its source of fresh water, and a food source.

##### Gula
The sister city of Achelous, built around the crater of the same name, and similar size to Achelous.

### Callisto
The most distant, and second largest of the Galilean moons is Callisto. Its terraforming was the most successful recorded, and left Callisto with a thriving tropical rainforest from pole to pole. The moon has high amounts of ozone allowing it to trap heat very well, and resulting in the thriving of plant life. Due to the use of non-polluting food and energy sources, the human presence on the moon does not contribute to the ozone levels, and the ecosystem remains balanced. The ecosystem of Callisto continues to be studied to this day and is the perfect example to future terraforming projects.

### Io
The closest of the Galilean moons to Jupiter, at a nearly perfect equatorial orbit, even after terraforming, Io is a hot wasteland. Covered in desert, the only populated areas are enclosed in giant domes built to keep moisture in. Those who venture outside of these domes must wear water retention suits to prevent the loss of precious water through evaporation or perspiration. Megavolcanos continue to leak ash and smoke into the atmosphere maintaining what is called the Static Haze. The Static Haze prevents all radio waves from penetrating it. The only data that can breech the haze is through SIGNET. This makes Io the hacker's paradise, as tracking a signal source without the use of satellites is nearly impossible thanks to the curvature of the moon.

### Europa
The surface of Europa is flat and covered in ice. The temperature of the planet has risen significantly since its terraforming. Below the surface of Europa is an endless sea of saltwater. Heated by its core, the water is teeming with life. Some originating on Europa, some from the aquatic alien races that escaped the Krelavilla. During its terraforming, the human settlers experimented with genetic alteration creating a subrace of humans that can thrive under the sea. Tritons they named themselves. They have webbed feet and gills, and maintained the ability to breathe air. Humans also colonize the surface of Europa as part of the legitimate fishing industry, or as part of the underground crime world of the rim.

### Other Moons
Other moons of Jupiter are considered uncolonized territory, but hidden bases, small settlements, and alien life lurk in every corner of the solar system.

#### Amalthea
The third moon from Jupiter lies within the outer edge of the Amalthea Gossamer Ring. It is irregularly shaped, and only 250km at its widest dimension. It is reddish in color. Its surface is covered in water ice and craters and ridges. It was harvested of most of its water during the terraforming of the Galilean Moons.

#### Himalia
The sixth largest Jovian satellite is around 200km is diameter. It orbits on average 11 million km from Jupiter, yet is only the 11th most distant. It orbits Jupiter on a 27 degree incline and with 4 other satellites form the "Himalia group".

#### Elara
The sister moon to Himalia follows the same orbital path and is part of the Himalia group. It is only about 86km in diameter. There are several abandoned ice mining stations there.

#### Pasiphae
At about 40km in diameter Pasiphae only has the surface gravity of 1/500th of that of earth. It has an elliptical orbit ranging from 17 million km at its closest approach to Jupiter, to over 31 million km at its furthest. There is an abandoned outpost dug into tunnels within the rock.

#### Metis
The closest moon to Jupiter orbits at only 126,000km. It is irregular in shape with dimensions 60 x 40 x 34 km. Due to its near perfect equatorial orbit, and orbital period of only 7 hours, Metis has been the transport hub of Jupiter allowing passengers to planet-hop between Jovian moons in just a day or two. It is the busiest spaceport in the rim; facilitating commerce between the diverse Jovian moons. The spaceport is built into the core of the moon. Outside of the moon lies the engineering marvel called "The Ring". A halo 75km in circumference spins around Metis simulating gravity for the 800,000 residents and visitors. The Ring is 1km wide and 20 stories tall. Eight great spokes join The Ring to the moon containing banks of freight and passenger elevators that lead to the spaceport. Most of the residents are employees of the spaceport, and its support infrastructure. Dozens of brothels, casinos, shops and restaurants entertain the travelers on layover, and the scores dock workers.
