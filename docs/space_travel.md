### Ship Encounters

Space encounters should be kept simple, and contained in the theater of the mind. The players should know what their ship has at their disposal. You describe the situation, and the pilot describes the maneuver they wish to perform. They make a piloting check against a DC determined by the DM.

Ship encounters should be short, simple, and cinematic. In this universe, the point of ship to ship combat is not to destroy, but comandeer enemy vessels. These huge ships take trillions of credits of wealth, and years to build. Squandering all that for an easy victory is foolish, and dishonorable.

<br>

> ### Example Encounter
> **DM**: An enemy RipWing appears around an asteroid in hot pursuit, and fires 2 missiles.<br>
**Pilot**: I make a tight turn around an asteroid.<br>
**DM**: That is a moderate difficult encounter. Make a Piloting check.
> *Pilot passes DC 15 Piloting check*<br>
> **DM**: Following your heat signature the missiles crash into the asteroid.<br>
> **Player**: As I come around the other side I fire my rail guns into the enemy ship.<br>
> **DM**: Since the enemy ship is coming at you fast, that's a *hard* shot.<br>
>*Pilot succeeds DC 20 Piloting check. Natural 20.*<br>
>**DM**: A barage of bullets make a direct hit to the engineering deck completely disabling the ship. It is dead in the water.<br>
>**Player**: I would like to board the ship.
