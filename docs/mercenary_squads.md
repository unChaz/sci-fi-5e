## Squad Combat

Whether you employ a squad of mercenaries, or your family/corporation have marine retainers in their service, having a squad of marines at your back is essential for many types of incursions. A group of marines can be broken up into any number of squads, but each squad will only take orders from 1 PC leader.

Mercenaries are expendable soldiers that can make or break any combat engagement. Many mercenaries have stack insurance ensuring that if they are killed in battle, they will receive a new sleeve. Real death is rare among mercenaries, and most will avoid aiming for the stack of a fellow mercenary as honor demands.

Mercenaries do well against other mercenaries and weaker foes, but against a more formidable foe, such as a razor wielding lancer, they will be torn apart.

### Mercenary Salary
A single mercenary can be employed for 100 credits per day. A mercenary squad of 10 marines can be conscripted for 600 credits per day for a minimum of 1 week, or 1000 credits per day otherwise.

### Combat Mechanics

Mercenary squads roll initiative as a group with no initiative bonus. A PC squad leader can give orders to their squad with a bonus action. The squad will continue to follow that order until told differently. You can specify specific members of the squad with the order. Other squad members will continue with their previous orders.

### Leadership Inspiration

With the Inspiring Leader feat, your squad of marines gain +2 to initiative rolls, and +2 to Armor Class. This bonus only applies to marines directly under your command.
