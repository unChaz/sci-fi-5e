## Classes

# Arcanist

The Arcanist is a scholar who has studied the nuanced science of tekcasting, also known as the Arcane Arts.

### Hit Points

**Hit Dice:** 1d6 per Arcanist level

**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 6 + your Constitution Modifier

**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution Modifier per Arcanist level after 1st

### Proficiencies

**Armor:** None

**Weapons:** ion daggers, darts, slings, bowstaffs, scorchers

**Tools:** None

**Saving Throws:** Intelligence, Wisdom

**Skills:** Choose two from Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine

### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
* *(a)* a Bowstaff or (*b*) an ion dagger
* *(a)* a component pouch or (*b*) an tekcaster
* *(a)* a scholar's pack or (*b*) a field survival kit
* A datapad

### Tekcasting

As a student of arcane tek, you have a tek skill datapad containing tek skills that show the first glimmerings of your true power.

### Cantrips

At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the Arcanist tek skill list. You learn additional Arcanist cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Arcanist table.

### Tek Datapad

At 1st level, you have a tek skill datapad containing six 1st- level Arcanist tek skills of your choice. Your tek skill datapad is the repository of the Arcanist tek skills you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.


### Preparing and Casting Tek Skills

The Arcanist table shows how many tek skill slots you have to cast your tek skills of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these tek skills, you must expend a slot of the tek skill's level or higher. You regain all expended tek skill slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of Arcanist tek skills that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of Arcanist tek skills from your tek skill datapad equal to your Intelligence modifier + your Arcanist level (minimum of one tek skill). The tek skills must be of a level for which you have tek skill slots.

You can change your list of prepared tek skills when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of Arcanist tek skills requires time spent studying your tek skill datapad and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the tek skill: at least 1 minute per tek skill level for each tek skill on your list.

### Tekcasting Ability

Intelligence + Will is your Tekcasting ability for your Arcanist tek skills, since you learn your tek skills through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a tek skill refers to your Tekcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an arcanist tek skill you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Tek save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier + your Will modifier

**Tek attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier + your Will modifier

### Ritual Casting

You can cast an arcanist tek skill as a ritual if that tek skill has the ritual tag and you have the tek skill in your tek skill datapad. You don't need to have the tek skill prepared.

### Tekcasting Focus

You can use an tekcaster as a Tekcasting focus for your Arcanist tek skills.

#### Learning Tek Skills of 1st Level and Higher

Each time you gain an arcanist level, you can add two Arcanist tek skills of your choice to your tek skill datapad for free. Each of these tek skills must be of a level for which you have tek skill slots, as shown on the Arcanist table. On your adventures, you might find other tek skills that you can add to your tek skill datapad (see the “Your tek skill datapad” sidebar).

### Arcane Recovery

You have learned to regain some of your tek energy by studying your tek skill datapad. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended tek skill slots to recover. The tek skill slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your Arcanist level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.

For example, if you're a 4th-level Arcanist, you can recover up to two levels worth of tek skill slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level tek skill slot or two 1st-level tek skill slots.

### Arcane Tradition

When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of tek through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation, all detailed at the end of the class description.

Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

```
```

### Tek Mastery

At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain tek skills that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level Arcanist tek skill and a 2nd-level Arcanist tek skill that are in your tek skill datapad. You can cast those tek skills at their lowest level without expending a tek skill slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either tek skill at a higher level, you must expend a tek skill slot as normal.

By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the tek skills you chose for different tek skills of the same levels.

### Signature Tek Skills

When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful tek skills and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level Arcanist tek skills in your tek skill datapad as your signature tek skills. You always have these tek skills prepared, they don't count against the number of tek skills you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a tek skill slot. When you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

If you want to cast either tek skill at a higher level, you must expend a tek skill slot as normal.

## Arcane Traditions

The study of the arcane arts began with the discoveries of tek.

The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of tek. Arcanists through the centuries have cataloged thousands of tek skills, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools; an arcanist might study at the School of Illusion while another studies across town at the School of Enchantment. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even Arcanists who train apprentices in the solitude of their own apartments use the division of tek into schools as a learning device, since the tek skills of each school require mastery of different techniques.

## School of Evocation

You focus your study on tek that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling concussive, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as pirates, explorers, or aspiring tyrants.

### Evocation Savant

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the credits and time you must spend to copy an evocation tek skill into your tek skill datapad is halved.

### Sculpt Tek Skills

Beginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocation tek skills. When you cast an evocation tek skill that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the tek skill's level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the tek skill, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.

### Potent Cantrip

Starting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip's damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.

### Empowered Evocation

Beginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of any Arcanist evocation tek skill you cast.

```
```

### Overchannel

Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler tek skills. When you cast an arcanist tek skill of 1st through 5th level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that tek skill.

The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 radiation damage for each level of the tek skill, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the radiation damage per tek skill level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.

> ## Your tek skill datapad
>
> Arcanists use a datapad to compile all of the knowledge of the arcane arts.
>
> The tek skills that you add to your tek skill datapad as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other tek skills during your adventures. You could discover a tek skill recorded on a datacube in an evil Arcanist's chest, for example, or in a dusty disk in an ancient library.
>
> **_Copying a Tek into the Datapad._** When you find an arcanist tek skill of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your tek skill datapad if it is of a tek skill level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.
>
> Copying that tek skill into your tek skill datapad involves reproducing the basic form of the tek skill, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the Arcanist who wrote it. You must practice the tek skill until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then type it into your tek skill datapad using your own notation. If the tek skill is in the form of digital data, it can simply be scanned into your datapad, but you must still spend time to learn how to use it.
>
> For each level of the tek skill, the process takes 2 hours and costs 5000 credits.

# Brute

______

### Hit Points

**Hit Dice:** 1d12 per brute level

**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 12 + your Constitution Modifier

**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d12 (or 7) + your Constitution Modifier per brute level after 1st

### Proficiencies

**Armor:** Light armor, medium armor, pulse shields

**Weapons:** Simple weapons, martial weapons

**Tools:** None

**Saving Throws:** Strength, Constitution

**Skills:** Choose two from  Athletics, Intimidation, Perception, and Science

### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

* (*a*) a pulse axe or (*b*) any martial melee weapon
* (*a*) a pulse fist or (*b*) any simple weapon
* a field survival kit and two ion daggers

### Rage

In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.

While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:

* You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
* When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a brute, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Brute table.
* You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

If you are able to cast tek skills, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.

Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.

Once you have raged the number of times shown for your brute level in the Rages column of the Brute table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.


### Unarmored Defense

While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution Modifier. You can use A medkit and still gain this benefit.

```
```

### Reckless Attack

Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.

### Danger Sense

At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.

You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and tek skills. To gain this benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.

### Primal Path

At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Choose the Path of the Berserker or the Path of the Totem Warrior, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Fast Movement

Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing heavy armor.

### Heavily Armored

Starting at 5th level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor.

### Feral Instinct

By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.

Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren't incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.

### Brutal Critical

Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack. This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.

| 20th   | +6                | Primal Champion               | Unlimited | +4          |

### Relentless Rage

Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you're raging and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.

Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.

### Persistent Rage

Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it.

### Indomitable Might

Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.

```
```

### Primal Champion

At 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.

## Brute Paths

### Path of the Berserker

For some brutes, rage is a means to an end— that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker's rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.

#### Frenzy
Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion (as described in appendix A).

#### Mindless Rage

Beginning at 6th level, you can't be charmed or frightened while raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage.

#### Intimidating Presence

Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.

If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can't use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.

#### Retaliation

Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.

# Cybernetic
_______
***requires bionic or synthetic Skin***

Cybernetics are tekcasters who have integrated with an alien AI via synthetic Skin parts. At some point you encountered an Alien AI, and it copied itself into your circuits.

### Hit Points

**Hit Dice:** 1d8 per cybernetic level

**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution Modifier

**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution Modifier per cybernetic level after 1st

### Proficiencies

**Armor:** Light armor

**Weapons:** Simple weapons

**Tools:** None

**Saving Throws:** Wisdom, Wit

**Skills:** Choose two skills from History, Charm, Intimidation, Investigation, and Science

### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
* *(a)* a scorcher and 20 clips of ammunition or (*b*) any simple weapon
* *(a)* a scholar's pack or (*b*) an incursion kit
* a tekcaster
* scarab skin, and two ion daggers

### Bionic Enhancements

At 1st level, to allow you to to seamlessly interface with computers, you have been upgraded with bionic enhancements. Your Skin must be synthetic, bionic, or you have paid to have custom bionic enhancements installed.

### AI Patron

At 1st level, through your bionic enhancements, you have bonded with an ancient alien AI called a "Symbiote". Your Symbiote makes it easy for you to interface with nearby networks and computers, and usually comes with a quirky personality.

### Symbiote Tek

Your arcane research and the tek bestowed on you by your Symbiote have given you facility with tek skills.

### Cantrips

You know two cantrips of your choice from the cybernetic tek skill list. You learn additional cybernetic cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cybernetic table.

```
```

### Tek Slots

The Cybernetic table shows how many tek skill slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your tek skill slots are the same level. To cast one of your cybernetic tek skills of 1st level or higher, you must expend a tek skill slot. You regain all expended tek skill slots when you finish a short or long rest.

For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level tek skill slots. To cast the 1st-level tek skill *shockwave*, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level tek skill.

### Tek Skills Known of 1st Level and Higher

At 1st level, you know two 1st-level tek skills of your choice from the cybernetic tek skill list.

The Tek Skills Known column of the Cybernetic table shows when you learn more cybernetic tek skills of your choice of 1st level and higher. A tek skill you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new cybernetic tek skill, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the cybernetic tek skills you know and replace it with another tek skill from the cybernetic tek skill list, which also must be of a level for which you have tek skill slots.

### Tekcasting Ability

Wit + Will is your Tekcasting ability for your cybernetic tek skills, so you use your Wit whenever a tek skill refers to your Tekcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wit modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cybernetic tek skill you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Tek save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wit modifier

**Tek attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wit modifier


### Tekcasting Focus

You can use an tekcaster as a Tekcasting focus for your cybernetic tek skills.

## Nanotech

Your Symbiote provides you with access to alien nanotech that imbue you with an abiding tek ability.

At 2nd level, you gain two nanotech modules of your choice. Your module options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain cybernetic levels, you gain additional modules of your choice, as shown in the Modules Known column of the Cybernetic table.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the modules you know and replace it with another module that you could learn at that level.

### Symbiotic Links

At 3rd level, your Symbiote gives you one of the following features of your choice.

## Link of the Drone

You learn the *find familiar* tek skill and can cast it as a ritual. The tek skill doesn't count against your number of tek skills known.

When you cast the tek skill, the form of your familiar is a recon drone with a fly speed of 60, 13 AC, 7 HP, Perception +3, Stealth +4, 60ft of darkvision, 10ft of blindsight.

The familiar is controlled by your Symbiote, and you gain all normal benefits of a familiar.

Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its reaction.

## Link of the Blade

You can use your action to create a Nanoblade in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as tek for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nontek attacks and damage.

Your Nanoblade disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.

You can transform one tek weapon into your Nanoblade by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your Nanoblade thereafter. You can't affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your Nanoblade if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.

\page

## Link of the Tome

Your Symbiote gives you access to more tekskills. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class's tek skill list (the three needn't be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don't count against your number of cantrips known. If they don't appear on the cybernetic tek skill list, they are nonetheless cybernetic tek skills for you.

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Mystic Arcanum

At 11th level, your Symbiote bestows upon you a tek secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th- level tek skill from the cybernetic tek skill list as this arcanum.

You can cast your arcanum tek skill once without expending a tek skill slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

At higher levels, you gain more cybernetic tek skills of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th- level tek skill at 13th level, one 8th-level tek skill at 15th level, and one 9th-level tek skill at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.

### Symbiote Master

At 20th level, you can draw on your reserve of tak power while entreating your Symbiote to regain expended tek skill slots. You can spend 1 minute entreating your Symbiote for aid to regain all your expended tek skill slots from your Link Tek feature. Once you regain tek skill slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

### AI Symbiotes

The beings that serve as Symbiotes for cybernetics are ancient alien AI that sat dormant for thousands of years. Once you form a link with your Symbiote, it makes a copy of itself inside your cybernetic circuitry.

#### The Fiend

You have formed a bond with the remnants of an AI from before the great AI war, a being whose aims are evil, even if you strive against those aims. Such beings desire the corruption or destruction of all things, ultimately including you. These AI, while symbiotic to you, and cannot function outside of your body, are constantly tempting you to do evil things, and is obsessed with destruction.

### Expanded Tek List

The Fiend lets you choose from an expanded list of tek skills when you learn a cybernetic tek skill. The following tek skills are added to the cybernetic tek skill list for you.

**Fiend Expanded Tek Skills (table)**

| Tek Level | Tek Skills |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| 1st | burning hands, command |
| 2nd | blindness/deafness, scorching ray |
| 3rd | fireball, stinking cloud |
| 4th | fire shield, wall of fire |
| 5th | flame strike, hallow |

### Alien's Blessing

Starting at 1st level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Wit modifier + your cybernetic level (minimum of 1).

### Alien's Own Luck

Starting at 6th level, you can call on your Symbiote to alter fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add a d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the initial roll but before any of the roll's effects occur.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

\page

### Alien Resilience

Starting at 10th level, you can choose one damage type when you finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature. Damage from tek weapons or silver weapons ignores this resistance.

### Hurl Through Dimensions

Starting at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can use this feature to instantly transport the target through the lower planes. The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape.

At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is not a fiend, it takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific experience.

### The Hexblade

You have made a bond with an ancient alien nanoblade. These Hexblades were created to destroy only evil, and were designed to transform themselves into harmless when a holder attempted to do evil with them. Over the ages their AI has evolved to discover its own ambitions, and attempts to use you to accomplish them.

### Expanded Tek List

The Fiend lets you choose from an expanded list of tek skills when you learn a cybernetic tek skill. The following tek skills are added to the cybernetic tek skill list for you.

**Fiend Expanded Tek Skills (table)**

| Tek Level | Tek Skills |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| 1st | shield, wrathful smite |
| 2nd | blur, branding smite |
| 3rd | blink, elemental weapon |
| 4th | phantasmal killer, staggering smite |
| 5th | banishing smite, cone of cold |

### Blade Hex

Starting at 1st level, you gain the ability to place a baleful curse on someone. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target is cursed for 1 minute. The curse ends early if the target dies, you die, or you are incapacitated. Until the curse ends, you gain the following benefits:

- You gain a bonus to damage rolls against the cursed target. The bonus equals your proficiency bonus.
- Any attack roll you make against the cursed target is a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.
- If the cursed target dies, you regain hit points equal to your warlock level + your Wit modifier (minimum of 1 hit point).
- You can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.

```
```

## Hex Warrior

At 1st level, you acquire the training necessary to effectively arm yourself for battle. You gain proficiency with medium armor, and martial weapons.

The influence of your patron also allows you to mystically channel your will through a particular weapon. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one weapon that you are proficient with and that lacks the two-handed property. When you attack with that weapon, you can use your Wit modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest. If you later gain the Pact of the Blade feature, this benefit extends to every pact weapon you conjure with that feature, no matter the weapon's type.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Accursed Specter

Starting at 6th level, you can curse the soul of a person you slay, temporarily binding it to your service. When you slay a humanoid, you can cause its spirit to rise from its corpse as a specter, the statistics for which are in the Monster Manual. When the specter appears, it gains temporary hit points equal to half your warlock level. Roll initiative for the specter, which has its own turns. It obeys your verbal commands, and it gains a special bonus to its attack rolls equal to your Wit modifier (minimum of +0).

The specter remains in your service until the end of your next long rest, at which point it vanishes to the afterlife.

Once you bind a specter with this feature, you can't use the feature again until you finish a long rest.

## Armor of Hexes
At 10th level, your hex grows more powerful. If the target cursed by your Hexblade's Curse hits you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to roll a d6. On a 4 or higher, the attack instead misses you, regardless of its roll.

## Master of Hexes
Starting at 14th level, you can spread your Hexblade's Curse from a slain creature to another creature. When the creature cursed by your Hexblade's Curse dies, you can apply the curse to a different creature you can see within 30 feet of you, provided you aren't incapacitated. When you apply the curse in this way, you don't regain hit points from the death of the previously cursed creature.

* (*a*) a ukulele or (*b*) any other musical instrument
* scarab skin and an ion dagger


### Tekcasting

You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in harmony with your wishes and music.

Your tek skills are part of your vast repertoire, tek that you can tune to different situations.

#### Cantrips

You know two cantrips of your choice from the evangelist tek skill list. You learn additional evangelist cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Evangelist table.

#### Tek Slots

The Evangelist table shows how many tek skill slots you have to cast your tek skills of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these tek skills, you must expend a slot of the tek skill's level or higher. You regain all expended tek skill slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level tek skill *cure wounds* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level tek skill slot available, you can cast *cure wounds* using either slot.

```
```

##### Tek Skills Known of 1st Level and Higher

You know four 1st-level tek skills of your choice from the evangelist tek skill list.

The Tek Skills Known column of the Evangelist table shows when you learn more evangelist tek skills of your choice. Each of these tek skills must be of a level for which you have tek skill slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new tek skill of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the evangelist tek skills you know and replace it with another tek skill from the evangelist tek skill list, which also must be of a level for which you have tek skill slots.

#### Tekcasting Ability

Charisma + Wit is your Tekcasting ability for your evangelist tek skills. Your tek comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a tek skill refers to your Tekcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a evangelist tek skill you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Tek save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier + your Will modifier + your Wit modifier

**Tek attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier + your Wit modifier

##### Ritual Casting

You can cast any evangelist tek skill you know as a ritual if that tek skill has the ritual tag.

##### Tekcasting Focus

You can use a tek integrated musical instrument (see chapter 5, “Equip-ment”) as a Tekcasting focus for your evangelist tek skills.

#### Evangelistic Inspiration

You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Evangelistic Inspiration die, a d6.

Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Evangelistic Inspiration die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Evangelistic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Evangelistic Inspiration die at a time.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Your Evangelistic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.

</div>

### Jack of All Trades

Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus.

### Song of Rest

Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.

The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.

### Evangelist College

At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a evangelist college of your choice: the College of Lore or the College of Valor, both detailed at the end of

the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level.

```
```

### Expertise

At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.

At 10th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this benefit.

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Font of Inspiration

Beginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Evangelistic Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest.

\page

#### Countercharm

At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).

#### Tek Secrets

By 10th level, you have plundered tek knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines. Choose two tek skills from any class, including this one. A tek skill you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Evangelist table, or a cantrip.

The chosen tek skills count as evangelist tek skills for you and are included in the number in the Tek Skills Known column of the Evangelist table.

You learn two additional tek skills from any class at 14th level and again at 18th level.

### Superior Inspiration

At 20th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Evangelistic Inspiration left, you regain one use.

## Evangelist Colleges

### College of Lore

Evangelists of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly blogs and white papers. These evangelists use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith to the loyalty of their organization.

The loyalty of these evangelists lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a sect. A noble who keeps such a evangelist as a herald or advisor knows that the evangelist would rather be honest than politic.

The college's members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.

#### Bonus Proficiencies

When you join the College of Lore at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with three skills of your choice.

```
```

#### Cutting Words

Also at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of Evangelistic Inspiration, rolling a Evangelistic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature's roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the GM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage. The creature is immune if it can't hear you or if it's immune to being charmed.

#### Additional Tek Secrets

At 6th level, you learn two tek skills of your choice from any class. A tek skill you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Evangelist table, or a cantrip. The chosen tek skills count as evangelist tek skills for you but don't count against the number of evangelist tek skills you know.

#### Peerless Skill

Starting at 14th level, when you make an ability check, you can expend one use of Evangelistic Inspiration. Roll a Evangelistic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your ability check. You can choose to do so after you roll the die for the ability check, but before the GM tells you whether you succeed or fail.

# Guardian

Guardians are warriors who pledged an oath to an alien entity, usually lawful-good. In exchange for their oaths they have been given a tekcaster and the secrets of casting Guardian tekskills.

### Hit Points

**Hit Dice:** 1d10 per guardian level

**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 10 + your Constitution Modifier

**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution Modifier per guardian level after 1st

### Proficiencies

**Armor:** All armor, pulse shields

**Weapons:** Simple weapons, martial weapons

**Tools:** None

**Saving Throws:** Wisdom, Charisma

**Skills:** Choose two from Athletics, Insight, Intimidation, Medicine, Charm, and Religion

### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
* (*a*) a martial weapon and a medkit or (*b*) two martial weapons
* (*a*) a scorcher (*b*) any simple melee weapon
* (*a*) a chaplin's pack or (*b*) a field survival kit
* scarab skin and a holy symbol

## Alien Sense

The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any Alien, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (Alien, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire

Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the *hallow* tek skill.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.

```
```

## Lay on Hands

Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your guardian level × 5.

As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.

Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.

This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.

## Fighting Style

At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

### Defense

While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

### Dueling

When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

### Great Weapon Fighting

When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

### Protection

When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding A medkit.

\page

## Tekcasting

By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on Alien tek through meditation and prayer to cast tek skills as a priest does.

### Preparing and Casting Tek Skills

The Guardian table shows how many tek skill slots you have to cast your tek skills. To cast one of your guardian tek skills of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the tek skill's level or higher. You regain all expended tek skill slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of guardian tek skills that are available for you to cast, choosing from the guardian tek skill list. When you do so, choose a number of guardian tek skills equal to your Charisma modifier + half your guardian level, rounded down (minimum of one tek skill). The tek skills must be of a level for which you have tek skill slots.

For example, if you are a 5th-level guardian, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level tek skill slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared tek skills can include four tek skills of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level tek skill *cure wounds,* you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd- level slot. Casting the tek skill doesn't remove it from your list of prepared tek skills.

You can change your list of prepared tek skills when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of guardian tek skills requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per tek skill level for each tek skill on your list.

### Tekcasting Ability

Charisma + Will is your Tekcasting ability for your guardian tek skills, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a tek skill refers to your Tekcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a guardian tek skill you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Tek save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier + your Will modifier

**Tek attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier + your Will modifier + your Wit modifier

### Tekcasting Focus

You can use a holy symbol as a Tekcasting focus for your guardian tek skills.

### Radiant Smite

Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one tek skill slot to deal kinetic damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level tek skill slot, plus 1d8 for each tek skill level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend.

### Alien Immunity

By 3rd level, the Alien tek flowing through you makes you immune to disease.

```
```

### Sacred Oath

When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a guardian forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it.

Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath tek skills and the Channel Divinity feature.

### Oath Tek Skills

Each oath has a list of associated tek skills. You gain access to these tek skills at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath tek skill, you always have it prepared. Oath tek skills don't count against the number of tek skills you can prepare each day.

If you gain an oath tek skill that doesn't appear on the guardian tek skill list, the tek skill is nonetheless a guardian tek skill for you.

### Channel Divinity

Your oath allows you to channel Alien energy to fuel tek effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.

When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.

Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your guardian tek skill save DC.

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Aura of Protection

Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

</div>
### Aura of Courage

Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can't be frightened while you are conscious.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

### Improved Radiant Smite

By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry Radiant power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiation damage. If you also use your Alien Smite with an attack, you add this damage to the extra damage of your Alien Smite.

## Cleansing Touch

Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one tek skill on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.

```
```
### Sacred Oaths

Becoming a guardian involves taking vows that commit the guardian to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the guardian's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true guardians until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the guardian's heart.

#### Oath of Devotion

The Oath of Devotion binds a guardian to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, lancers, or holy warriors, these guardians meet the ideal of the Lancer in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to the laws of morality and use them as the measure of their devotion. Some hold protheans as the perfect servants of good, and incorporate images of protheans into their helmets or coats of arms.

\page

### Tenets of Devotion

Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, guardians of this oath share these tenets.

**_Honesty._** Don't lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise.

**_Courage._** Never fear to act, though caution is wise.

**_Compassion._** Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom.

**_Honor._** Treat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be an example to them. Do as much good as possible while causing the least amount of harm.

**_Duty._** Be responsible for your actions and their consequences, protect those entrusted to your care, and obey those who have just authority over you.

### Oath Tek Skills

You gain oath tek skills at the guardian levels listed.

**Oath of Devotion Tek Skills (table)**

| Level | Guardian Tek Skills                           |
|-------|------------------------------------------|
| 3rd   | protection from evil and good, sanctuary |
| 5th   | lesser restoration, zone of truth        |
| 9th   | beacon of hope, dispel tek             |
| 13th  | freedom of movement, guardian of faith   |
| 17th  | commune, flame strike                    |

### Channel Divinity

When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.

**_Radiant Weapon._** As an action, you can imbue one weapon that you are holding with positive energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already tek, it becomes tek for the duration.

You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.

**_Turn the Unholy._** As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

```
```

### Aura of Devotion

Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can't be charmed while you are conscious.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

### Purity of Spirit

Beginning at 15th level, you are always under the effects of a *protection from evil and good* tek skill.

### Radiant Nimbus

At 20th level, as an action, you can emanate an aura of sunlight. For 1 minute, bright light shines from you in a 30-foot radius, and dim light shines 30 feet beyond that.

Whenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the bright light, the creature takes 10 radiation damage.

In addition, for the duration, you have advantage on saving throws against tek skills cast by fiends or undead.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

> ## Breaking Your Oath
>
> A guardian tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous guardian is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a guardian to transgress his or her oath.
>
> A guardian who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a priest who shares his or her ideals or from another guardian of the same order. The guardian might spend an all- night vigil as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the guardian starts fresh.
>
> If a guardian willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM's discretion, an impenitent guardian might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.

#  Monk

###  Hit Points

**Hit Dice:** 1d8 per monk level

**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution Modifier

**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution Modifier per monk level after 1st

###  Proficiencies

**Armor:** None

**Weapons:** Simple weapons, ion blades

**Tools:** Choose one type of artisan's tools or one musical instrument

**Saving Throws:** Strength, Dexterity

**Skills:** Choose two from Acrobatics, Athletics, History, Insight, and Stealth

###  Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

* (*a*) a ion blade or (*b*) any simple weapon
* (*a*) an incursion kit or (*b*) a field survival kit
* 10 darts

###  Unarmored Defense

Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding A medkit, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Will modifier.

```
```

###  Martial Arts

At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are ion blades and any simple melee weapons that don't have the two- handed or heavy property.

You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren't wearing armor or wielding A medkit:

* You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.
* You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.
* When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a Bowstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn.

Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon.

##  Ki

Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table.

You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.

When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.

Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

**Ki save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

###  Flurry of Blows

Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.

###  Patient Defense

You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.

###  Step of the Wind

You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.

##  Unarmored Movement

Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding A medkit. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.

At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.

```
```

##  Monastic Tradition

When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition: the Way of the Open Hand, the Way of Shadow, or the Way of the Four Elements, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.

##  Deflect Missiles

Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.

If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.

\page

##  Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

##  Slow Fall

Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level.

##  Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

##  Stunning Strike

Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent's body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.

##  Ki-Empowered Strikes

Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as tek for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nontek attacks and damage.

##  Evasion

At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon's lightning breath or a *fireball* tek skill. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

##  Stillness of Mind

Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.

##  Purity of Body

At 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison.

##  Tongue of the Sun and Moon

Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say.

```
```

##  Diamond Soul

Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in all saving throws.

Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result.

##  Timeless Body

At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can't be aged. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water.

##  Empty Body

Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage.

Additionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the *astral projection* tek skill, without needing material components. When you do so, you can't take any other creatures with you.

##  Perfect Self

At 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki points remaining, you regain 4 ki points.

##  Monastic Traditions

Three traditions of monastic pursuit are common in the monasteries scattered across the multiverse. Most monasteries practice one tradition exclusively, but a few honor the three traditions and instruct each monk according to his or her aptitude and interest. All three traditions rely on the same basic techniques, diverging as the student grows more adept. Thus, a monk need choose a tradition only upon reaching 3rd level.

###  Way of the Open Hand

Monks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate masters of martial arts combat, whether armed or unarmed. They learn techniques to push and trip their opponents, manipulate ki to heal damage to their bodies, and practice advanced meditation that can protect them from harm.

####  Open Hand Technique

Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can manipulate your enemy's ki when you harness your own. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target:
* It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
* It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to 15 feet away from you.
* It can't take reactions until the end of your next turn.

\page

####  Wholeness of Body

At 6th level, you gain the ability to heal yourself. As an action, you can regain hit points equal to three times your monk level. You must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.

####  Tranquility

Beginning at 11th level, you can enter a special meditation that surrounds you with an aura of peace. At the end of a long rest, you gain the effect of a *sanctuary* tek skill that lasts until the start of your next long rest (the tek skill can end early as normal). The saving throw DC for the tek skill equals 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus.

####  Quivering Palm

At 17th level, you gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone's body. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 ki points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your monk level. The vibrations are harmless unless you use your action to end them. To do so, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you use this action, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it is reduced to 0 hit points. If it succeeds, it takes 10d10 radiation damage.

You can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time. You can choose to end the vibrations harmlessly without using an action.

\page
#  Morph

Morphs are tekcasters who have developed their tekcasting ability to strengthen their bond with nature. What began as a group of conservationists bringing tekcasters back to earth, developed into several cult-like organizations dedicating to unlocking the secrets of nature via tek.

###  Hit Points

**Hit Dice:** 1d8 per morph level

**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution Modifier

**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution Modifier per morph level after 1st

###  Proficiencies

**Armor:** Light armor, medium armor

**Weapons:** ion daggers, scorchers

**Tools:** Botanist's Kit

**Saving Throws:** Intelligence, Wisdom

**Skills:** Choose two from History, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Science

###  Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

* (*a*) a stun fist (*b*) any simple weapon
* (*a*) an ion blade or (*b*) any simple melee weapon
* scarab skin, a field survival kit, and a tekcaster

###  Morphic cant

You know Morphic, the secret language of morphs. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message's presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can't decipher it without tek.

###  Tekcasting

Drawing on the alien essence of tekcasters, you can cast tek skills to shape the essence of nature to your will.

###  Cantrips

At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the morph tek skill list. You learn additional morph cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Morph table.

```
```

###  Preparing and Casting Tek Skills

The Morph table shows how many tek skill slots you have to cast your tek skills of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these morph tek skills, you must expend a slot of the tek skill's level or higher. You regain all expended tek skill slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of morph tek skills that are available for you to cast, choosing from the morph tek skill list. When you do so, choose a number of morph tek skills equal to your Wisdom modifier + your morph level (minimum of one tek skill). The tek skills must be of a level for which you have tek skill slots.

For example, if you are a 3rd-level morph, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level tek skill slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared tek skills can include six tek skills of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level tek skill *cure wounds,* you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the tek skill doesn't remove it from your list of prepared tek skills.

You can also change your list of prepared tek skills when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of morph tek skills requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per tek skill level for each tek skill on your list.

##  Tekcasting Ability

Wisdom + Will is your Tekcasting ability for your morph tek skills, since your tek draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a tek skill refers to your Tekcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a morph tek skill you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Tek save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**Tek attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

##  Ritual Casting

You can cast a morph tek skill as a ritual if that tek skill has the ritual tag and you have the tek skill prepared.

###  Tekcasting Focus
You can use a tekcaster as a focus for your morph tek skills.

</div>

##  Wild Shape

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

Your morph level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed.

**Beast Shapes (table)**

| Level | Max. CR | Limitations                 | Example     |
|-------|---------|-----------------------------|-------------|
| 2nd   | 1/4     | No flying or swimming speed | Wolf        |
| 4th   | 1/2     | No flying speed             | Crocodile   |
| 8th   | 1       | —                           | Giant eagle |

You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your morph level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.

While you are transformed, the following rules apply:

* Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.
* When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.


* You can't cast tek skills, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a tek skill you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a tek skill, such as *call lightning*, that you've already cast.

\page

* You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.
* You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.

##  Morph Circle

Morphs have obtained their tek abilities from Morph Circles; cult like organizations that explore the possibilities of combining tekcasting with nature.

At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of morphs: the Circle of the Land or the Circle of the Moon, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

##  Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

##  Timeless Body

Starting at 18th level, the nature shifting tek that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.

##  Beast Tek Skills

Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your morph tek skills in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a morph tek skill while in a beast shape, but you aren't able to provide material components.

##  Archmorph

At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times.

Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your morph tek skills, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren't consumed by a tek skill. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.

```
```

##  Morph Circles

###  Circle of the Land

The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These morphs meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Morphic. The circle's wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your tek is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle's mysterious rites.

####  Bonus Cantrip

When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional morph cantrip of your choice.

####  Natural Recovery

Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your tek energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended tek skill slots to recover. The tek skill slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your morph level
(rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

For example, when you are a 4th-level morph, you can recover up to two levels worth of tek skill slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.

####  Circle Tek Skills

Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain tek skills. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle tek skills connected to the land where you became a morph. Choose that land—arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp—and consult the associated list of tek skills.

Once you gain access to a circle tek skill, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of tek skills you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a tek skill that doesn't appear on the morph tek skill list, the tek skill is nonetheless a morph tek skill for you.

####  Land's Stride

Starting at 6th level, moving through nontek difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nontek plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the *entangle* tek skill.

####  Nature's Ward

When you reach 10th level, you can't be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease.

####  Nature's Sanctuary

When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your morph tek skill save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.

The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you.

<br><br>

> ##  Sacred Plants and Wood
>
> A morph holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Morphs often use such plants as part of a Tekcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.
>
> Similarly, a morph uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and pulse shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for Ion Blades or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or Bowstaffs, as well as pulse shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or ion daggers.
>
> Morphs from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a morph of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.

#  Priest

###  Hit Points

**Hit Dice:** 1d8 per priest level

**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution Modifier

**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution Modifier per priest level after 1st

###  Proficiencies

**Armor:** Light armor, medium armor, pulse shields

**Weapons:** Simple weapons

**Tools:** None

**Saving Throws:** Wisdom, Charisma

**Skills:** Choose two from History, Insight, Medicine, and Charm

###  Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

* (*a*) a scorcher or (*b*) an ion slingblade (if proficient)
* (*a*) kevlar, (*b*) scarab skin, or (*c*) scarab skin (if proficient)
* (*a*) a scorcher and 20 clips of ammunition or (*b*) any simple weapon
* (*a*) a chaplin's pack or (*b*) a field survival kit
* A medkit and a religious symbol


###  Tekcasting

As a conduit for Alien power, you can cast priest tek skills.

```
```

###  Cantrips

At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the priest tek skill list. You learn additional priest cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Priest table.

###  Preparing and Casting Tek Skills

The Priest table shows how many tek skill slots you have to cast your tek skills of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these tek skills, you must expend a slot of the tek skill's level or higher. You regain all expended tek skill slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of priest tek skills that are available for you to cast, choosing from the priest tek skill list. When you do so, choose a number of priest tek skills equal to your Wisdom modifier + your priest level (minimum of one tek skill). The tek skills must be of a level for which you have tek skill slots.

For example, if you are a 3rd-level priest, you have four
1st-level and two 2nd-level tek skill slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared tek skills can include six tek skills of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level tek skill *cure wounds*, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the tek skill doesn't remove it from your list of prepared tek skills.

You can change your list of prepared tek skills when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of priest tek skills requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per tek skill level for each tek skill on your list.

###  Tekcasting Ability

Wisdom + Will is your Tekcasting ability for your priest tek skills. The power of your tek skills comes from your devotion to your host. You use your Wisdom whenever a priest tek skill refers to your Tekcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a priest tek skill you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Tek save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**Tek attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

###  Ritual Casting

You can cast a priest tek skill as a ritual if that tek skill has the ritual tag and you have the tek skill prepared.

##  Tekcasting Focus

You must use a tekcaster as a focus for your tekcasting abilities.

##  Alien Domain

Choose one domain related to your host: Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. Each domain is detailed at the end of the class description, and each one provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you domain tek skills and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.

###  Domain Tek Skills

Each domain has a list of tek skills—its domain tek skills— that you gain at the priest levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain tek skill, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of tek skills you can prepare each day.

If you have a domain tek skill that doesn't appear on the priest tek skill list, the tek skill is nonetheless a priest tek skill for you.


```
```

##  Channel Divinity

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel Alien energy directly from your host, using that energy to fuel tek effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.

When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.

Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your priest tek skill save DC.

Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel

Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.

###  Channel Divinity: Turn Undead

As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

\page

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

##  Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

##  Destroy Undead

Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table.


**Destroy Undead (table)**

| Priest Level | Destroys Undead of CR... |
|--------------|--------------------------|
| 5th          | 1/2 or lower             |
| 8th          | 1 or lower               |
| 11th         | 2 or lower               |
| 14th         | 3 or lower               |
| 17th         | 4 or lower               |

##  Alien Intervention

Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your host to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.

Imploring your host's aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your priest level, your host intervenes. The GM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any priest tek skill or priest domain tek skill would be appropriate.

If your host intervenes, you can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.

At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.

##  Priest Domains

###  Life Domain

The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy—one of the fundamental forces of the universe—that sustains all life. The gods of life promote vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of death and undeath. Almost any non-evil host can claim influence over this domain, particularly agricultural hosts (such as Chauntea, Arawai, and Demeter), sun gods (such as Lathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods of healing or endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and Diancecht), and gods of home and community (such as Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrei).

**Life Domain Tek Skills (table)**

| Priest Level | Tek Skills                               |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| 1st          | bless, cure wounds                   |
| 3rd          | lesser restoration, spiritual weapon |
| 5th          | beacon of hope, revivify             |
| 7th          | death ward, guardian of faith        |
| 9th          | mass cure wounds, raise dead         |

####  Bonus Proficiency

When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor.

####  Disciple of Life

Also starting at 1st level, your healing tek skills are more effective. Whenever you use a tek skill of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the tek skill's level.

####  Channel Divinity: Preserve Life

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to heal the badly injured.

As an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your priest level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can't use this feature on an undead or a construct.

####  Blessed Healer

Beginning at 6th level, the healing tek skills you cast on others heal you as well. When you cast a tek skill of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the tek skill's level.

####  Tek Strike

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with tek energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 kinetic damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

####  Supreme Healing

Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a tek skill, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12.

#  Scion

The scion gains their ability to use tek skills not from studying the science behind it as an Arcanist would, but from a connection with an ancient alien entity, whether it be through blood, or a chance encounter.

###  Hit Points

**Hit Dice:** 1d6 per scion level

**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 6 + your Constitution Modifier

**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution Modifier per scion level after 1st

###  Proficiencies

**Armor:** None

**Weapons:** ion daggers, scorchers

**Tools:** None

**Saving Throws:** Constitution, Charisma

**Skills:** Choose two from History, Charm, Insight, Intimidation, and Religion

###  Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
* (*a*) a scorcher and 20 clips of ammunition or (*b*) any simple weapon
* a tekcaster
* (*a*) an incursion kit or (*b*) a field survival kit
* Two ion daggers

###  Tekcasting

An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane tek. This font of tek, whatever its origin, fuels your tek skills.

###  Cantrips

At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the scion tek skill list. You learn additional scion cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Scion table.

###  Tek Slots

The Scion table shows how many tek skill slots you have to cast your tek skills of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these scion tek skills, you must expend a slot of the tek skill's level or higher. You regain all expended tek skill slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level tek skill *burning hands* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level tek skill slot available, you can cast *burning hands* using either slot.

```
```

###  Tek Skills Known of 1st Level and Higher

You know two 1st-level tek skills of your choice from the scion tek skill list.

The Tek Skills Known column of the Scion table shows when you learn more scion tek skills of your choice. Each of these tek skills must be of a level for which you have tek skill slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new tek skill of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the scion tek skills you know and replace it with another tek skill from the scion tek skill list, which also must be of a level for which you have tek skill slots.

###  Tekcasting Ability

Charisma + Will is your Tekcasting ability for your scion tek skills, since the power of your tek relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a tek skill refers to your Tekcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a scion tek skill you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Tek save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier + your Will modifier

**Tek attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier + your Will modifier + your Wit modifier

###  Tekcasting Focus

You can use an tekcaster as a Tekcasting focus for your scion tek skills.

##  Scionic Origin

Choose a scionic origin, which describes the source of your innate tek power: Alien Bloodline or Alien Soul, both detailed at the end of the class description.

Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.

##  Font of Tek

At 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of tek within yourself. This wellspring is represented by scion points, which allow you to create a variety of tek effects.

###  Scion Points

You have 2 scion points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Scion Points column of the Scion table. You can never have more scion points than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent scion points when you finish a long rest.

###  Flexible Casting

You can use your scion points to gain additional tek skill slots, or sacrifice tek skill slots to gain additional scion points. You learn other ways to use your scion points as you reach higher levels.

**_Creating Tek Slots._** You can transform unexpended scion points into one tek skill slot as a bonus action on your turn. The Creating Tek Slots table shows the cost of creating a tek skill slot of a given level. You can create tek skill slots no higher in level than 5th.

Any tek skill slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a long rest.

```
```

**Creating Tek Slots (table)**

| Tek Slot Level | Scion Point Cost |
|------------------|--------------------|
| 1st              | 2                  |
| 2nd              | 3                  |
| 3rd              | 5                  |
| 4th              | 6                  |
| 5th              | 7                  |

**_Converting a Tek Slot to Scion Points._** As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one tek skill slot and gain a number of scion points equal to the slot's level.

\page

##  Metatek

At 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your tek skills to suit your needs. You gain two of the following Metatek options of your choice. You gain another one at 10th and 17th level.

You can use only one Metatek option on a tek skill when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.

####  Careful Tek

When you cast a tek skill that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the tek skill's full force. To do so, you spend 1 scion point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the tek skill.

####  Distant Tek

When you cast a tek skill that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 scion point to double the range of the tek skill.

When you cast a tek skill that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 scion point to make the range of the tek skill 30 feet.

####  Empowered Tek

When you roll damage for a tek skill, you can spend 1 scion point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls.

You can use Empowered Tek even if you have already used a different Metatek option during the casting of the tek skill.

####  Extended Tek

When you cast a tek skill that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 scion point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.

#### Heightened Tek

When you cast a tek skill that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 scion points to give one target of the tek skill disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the tek skill.

####  Quickened Tek

When you cast a tek skill that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 scion points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.

####  Subtle Tek

When you cast a tek skill, you can spend 1 scion point to cast it without any somatic or verbal components.



####  Twinned Tek

When you cast a tek skill that targets only one creature and doesn't have a range of self, you can spend a number of scion points equal to the tek skill's level to target a second creature in range with the same tek skill (1 scion point if the tek skill is a cantrip).

To be eligible, a tek skill must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the tek skill's current level. For example, *tek missile* and *scorching ray* aren't eligible, but *ray of frost* and *chromatic orb* are.

##  Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

##  Scionic Restoration

At 20th level, you regain 4 expended scion points whenever you finish a short rest.

##  Scionic Origins

Different scions claim different origins for their innate tek. Although many variations exist, most of these origins fall into two categories: a alien bloodline and chaos tek.

###  Alien Bloodline

Your innate tek comes from alien tek that was mingled with your blood or that of your ancestors. Most often, scions with this origin trace their descent back to an alien of ancient times who parented a child with a human. Any given scion could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a scientific experiment involving alien DNA gone wrong.

####  Alien Ancestor

At 1st level, you choose one type of alien as your ancestor. The damage type associated with each alien is used by features you gain later.

**Alien Ancestry (table)**

| Alien | Damage Type |
|--------|-------------|
| Black  | Acid        |
| Blue   | Shock       |
| Gold   | Fire        |
| Green  | Poison      |
| Red    | Fire        |
| Silver | Cold        |


You can speak, read, and write Alien. Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting with aliens, your proficiency bonus is doubled if it applies to the check.

####  Alien Resilience

As tek flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your alien ancestors to emerge. At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.

Additionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of alien-like carapace. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.

\page

####  Elemental Affinity

Starting at 6th level, when you cast a tek skill that deals damage of the type associated with your alien ancestry, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that tek skill. At the same time, you can spend 1 scion point to gain resistance to that damage type for 1 hour.

####  Natural Levitation

At 14th level, you gain the ability to surround yourself with an alien glowing aura causing you to levitate, gaining a fly speed speed equal to your current speed. You can enable this ability as a bonus action on your turn. It lasts until you dismiss it as a bonus action on your turn.

####  Alien Presence

Beginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread presence of your alien ancestor, causing those around you to become awestruck or frightened. As an action, you can spend 5 scion points to draw on this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration tek skill), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose fear) until the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to your aura for 24 hours.

### Alien Soul

Sometimes the spark of tek that fuels a scion comes directly from a alien soul trapped inside your body.

A Alien Soul, with a natural magnetism, is seen as a threat by some religious hierarchies. As an outsider who commands sacred power, an Alien Soul can undermine an existing order by claiming to act under direct control of an alien entity.

In some cultures, only those who can claim the power of a Alien Soul may command religious power.

#### Alien Magic
Your link to the alien allows you to learn spells from the cleric class. When your Spellcasting feature lets you learn or replace a scion cantrip or a scion spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose the new spell from the cleric spell list or the scion spell list. You must otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting the spell, and it becomes a scion spell for you.

In addition, choose an affinity for the source of your alien power: good, evil, law, chaos, or neutrality. You learn an additional spell based on that affinity, as shown below. It is a scion spell for you, but it doesn’t count against your number of scion spells known. If you later replace this spell, you must replace it with a spell from the cleric spell list.

| Affinity |	Spell |
|--------|-----------|
| Good|	cure wounds|
| Evil|	inflict wounds|
| Law|	bless|
| Chaos|	bane|
| Neutrality|	protection from evil and good|

```
```

##### Chaos
You learn the bane spell, but it doesn’t count against your number of scion spells known. If you later replace this | spell, you must replace it with a spell from the cleric spell list.

##### Evil
You learn the inflict wounds spell, but it doesn’t count against your number of scion spells known. If you later replace this spell, you must replace it with a spell from the cleric spell list.

##### Good
You learn the cure wounds spell, but it doesn’t count against your number of scion spells known. If you later replace this spell, you must replace it with a spell from the cleric spell list.

##### Law
You learn the bless spell, but it doesn’t count against your number of scion spells known. If you later replace this spell, you must replace it with a spell from the cleric spell list.

##### Neutrality
You learn the protection from evil and good spell, but it doesn’t count against your number of scion spells known. If you later replace this spell, you must replace it with a spell from the cleric spell list.

#### Favored by the Gods
Starting at 1st level, alien power guards your destiny. If you fail a saving throw or miss with an attack roll, you can roll 2d4 and add it to the total, possibly changing the outcome. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Empowered Healing
Starting at 6th level, the alien energy coursing through you can empower healing spells. Whenever you or an ally within 5 feet of you rolls dice to determine the number of hit points a spell restores, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll any number of those dice once, provided you aren’t incapacitated. You can use this feature only once per turn.

#### Otherworldly Wings
Starting at 14th level, you can use a bonus action to manifest a pair of spectral wings from your back. While the wings are present, you have a flying speed of 30 feet. The wings last until you’re incapacitated, you die, or you dismiss them as a bonus action.

The affinity you chose for your Alien Magic feature determines the appearance of the spectral wings: eagle wings for good or law, bat wings for evil or chaos, and dragonfly wings for neutrality.

#### Unearthly Recovery
At 18th level, you gain the ability to overcome grievous injuries. As a bonus action when you have fewer than half of your hit points remaining, you can regain a number of hit points equal to half your hit point maximum.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

# Scoundrel

###  Hit Points

**Hit Dice:** 1d8 per scoundrel level

**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution Modifier

**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution Modifier per scoundrel level after 1st

###  Proficiencies

**Armor:** Light armor

**Weapons:** Simple weapons, scorchers, ion blades, pulse blades

**Tools:** Thieves' tools

**Saving Throws:** Dexterity, Intelligence

**Skills:** Choose four from Acrobatics, Computers, History, Athletics, Charm, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Perception, Performance, Trickery, and Stealth

###  Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
* (*a*) an ion blade or (*b*) two ion daggers
* (*a*) a scorcher and 20 clips of ammunition or (*b*) a ion blade
* (*a*) a hacker's kit, (*b*) an incursion kit, or (*c*) a field survival kit
* (*a*) scarab skin, two ion daggers, and thieves' tools

###  Expertise

At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves' tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.

At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves' tools) to gain this benefit.

###  Sneak Attack

Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.

You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Scoundrel table.

```
```

###  Thieves' Cant

During your scoundrel training you learned thieves' cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves' cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.

In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves' guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.

###  Cunning Action

Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

####  Roguish Archetype

At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your scoundrel abilities: Thief, Assassin, or Arcane Trickster, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.

###  Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

###  Uncanny Dodge

Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.

###  Evasion

Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an *ice storm* tek skill. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

###  Reliable Talent

By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

</div>

###  Blindsense

Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.

###  Slippery Mind

By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.

###  Elusive

Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't incapacitated.

###  Stroke of Luck

At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

```
```

##  Roguish Archetypes

Scoundrels have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different scoundrels steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the scoundrel archetypes. Your choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus—not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a description of your preferred techniques.

###  Thief

You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, Space Pirates, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do scoundrels who prefer to think of themselves as professional loot seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using alien artifacts you normally couldn't employ.

####  Fast Hands

Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Trickery) check, use your thieves' tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action.

\page

####  Second-Story Work

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement.

In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.

####  Supreme Stealth

Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.

####  Use Tek Device

By 13th level, you have learned enough about the workings of tek that you can improvise the use of items even when they are not intended for you. You ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use of alien artifacts.

####  Thief's Reflexes

When you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can't use this feature when you are surprised.


###  Gunslinger
The Gunslinger has lightning fast reflexes, and always keeps a scorcher on their hip.

####  Adept Marksman
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn to perform powerful trick shots to disable or damage your opponents using your firearms.

**Trick Shots.** You learn two trick shots of your choice, which are detailed under “Trick Shots” below. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. Each use of a trick shot must be declared before the attack roll is made. You can use only one trick shot per attack.

You learn an additional trick shot of your choice at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. Each time you learn a new trick shot, you can also replace one trick shot you know with a different one.

**Grit.** You gain a number of grit points equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). You regain 1 expended grit point each time you roll a 20 on the d20 roll for an attack with a firearm, or deal a killing blow with a firearm to a creature of significant threat (DM's discretion). You regain all expended grit points after a short or long rest.

**Saving Throws.** Some of your trick shots require your targets to make a saving throw to resist the trick shot's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

   **Trick Shot save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier

####  Quickdraw
When you reach 7th level, you add your proficiency bonus to your initiative. You can also stow a firearm, then draw another firearm as a single object interaction on your turn.

```
```
####  Rapid Reload
Starting at 10th level, you can reload any firearm as a bonus action.

Lightning Reload
Starting at 15th level, you can reload any firearm as a bonus action.

####  Vicious Intent
At 18th level, your firearm attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19-20, and you regain a grit point on a roll of 19 or 20 on a d20 attack roll.

####  Hemorrhaging Critical
Upon reaching 18th level, whenever you score a critical hit on an attack with a firearm, the target additionally suffers half of the damage from the attack at the end of its next turn.

####  Trick Shots
These trick shots are presented in alphabetical order.

**Bullying Shot**
You can use the powerful blast and thundering sound of your firearm to shake the resolve of a creature. You can expend one grit point while making a Intimidation check to gain advantage on the roll.

**Dazing Shot**
When you make a firearm attack against a creature, you can expend one grit point to attempt to dizzy your opponent. On a hit, the creature suffers normal damage and must make a Constitution saving throw or suffer disadvantage on attacks until the end of their next turn.

**Deadeye Shot**
When you make a firearm attack against a creature, you can expend one grit point to gain advantage on the attack roll.

**Disarming Shot**
When you make a firearm attack against a creature, you can expend one grit point to attempt to shoot an object from their hands. On a hit, the creature suffers normal damage and must succeed on a Strength saving throw or drop 1 held object of your choice and have that object be pushed 10 feet away from you.

**Forceful Shot**
When you make a firearm attack against a creature, you can expend one grit point to attempt to trip them up and force them back. On a hit, the creature suffers normal damage and must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you.

**Piercing Shot**
When you make a firearm attack against a creature, you can expend one grit point to attempt to fire through multiple opponents. The initial attack gains a +1 to the firearm's misfire score. On a hit, the creature suffers normal damage and you make an attack roll with disadvantage against every creature in a line directly behind the target within your first range increment. Only the initial attack can misfire.

**Violent Shot**
When you make a firearm attack against a creature, you can expend one or more grit points to enhance the volatility of the attack. For each grit point expended, the attack gains a +2 to the firearms attack bonus. If the attack hits, you can roll one additional weapon damage die per grit point spent when determining the damage.

**Winging Shot**
When you make a firearm attack against a creature, you can expend one grit point to attempt to topple a moving target. On a hit, the creature suffers normal damage and must make a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

\page

### Mastermind

Your focus is on people and on the influence and secrets they have. Many spies, courtiers, and schemers follow this archetype, leading lives of intrigue. Words are your weapons as often as knives or poison, and secrets and favors are some of your favorite treasures.

#### Master of Intrigue
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the disguise kit, the forgery kit, and one gaming set of your choice. You also learn two languages of your choice.

Additionally, you can unerringly mimic the speech patterns and accent of a creature that you hear speak for at least 1 minute, enabling you to pass yourself off as a native speaker of a particular land, provided that you know the language.

#### Master of Tactics
Starting at 3rd level, you can use the Help action as a bonus action. Additionally, when you use the Help action to aid an ally in attacking a creature, the target of that attack can be within 30 feet of you, rather than within 5 feet of you, if the target can see or hear you.

#### Insightful Manipulator
Starting at 9th level, if you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature outside combat, you can learn certain information about its capabilities compared to your own. The DM tells you if the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics of your choice:

- Intelligence score
- Wisdom score
- Wit score
- Class levels (if any)

At the DM's option, you might also realize you know a piece of the creature's history or one of its personality traits, if it has any.

#### Misdirection
Beginning at 13th level, you can sometimes cause another creature to suffer an attack meant for you. When you are targeted by an attack while a creature within 5 feet of you is granting you cover against that attack, you can use your reaction to have the attack target that creature instead of you.

#### Soul of Deceit
Starting at 17th level, your thoughts can't be read by telepathy or other means, unless you allow it. You can present false thoughts by succeeding on a Deception check contested by the mind reader's Wisdom (Insight) check.

Additionally, no matter what you say, magic that would determine if you are telling the truth indicates you are being truthful if you so choose, and you can't be compelled to tell the truth by magic.

\page
# Scout
Modern scouts are very different from those of the past. Today scouts must be versatile enough to track a quarry within the metal hulls of spacecraft or space stations, and in the many types of environment found planet-side on the many habitable planets and moons. Scouts specialize in ranged and martial combat, and employ the use of tekcasting to enhance their combat viability.

### Hit Points

**Hit Dice:** 1d10 per scout level

**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 10 + your Constitution Modifier

**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution Modifier per scout level after 1st

Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy.

Choose a type of favored enemy: humans, aberrations, beasts, aliens, robots, dragons, elementals, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two factions of humans as favored enemies.

You have advantage on Knowledge checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.

When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.

You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures.

```
```

While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

</div>
### Tek Slots

The Scout table shows how many tek skill slots you have to cast your tek skills of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these tek skills, you must expend a slot of the tek skill's level or higher. You regain all expended tek skill slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level tek skill *animal friendship* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level tek skill slot available, you can cast *animal friendship* using either slot.

#### Tek Skills Known of 1st Level and Higher

You know two 1st-level tek skills of your choice from the scout tek skill list.

The Tek Skills Known column of the Scout table shows when you learn more scout tek skills of your choice. Each of these tek skills must be of a level for which you have tek skill slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new tek skill of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the scout tek skills you know and replace it with another tek skill from the scout tek skill list, which also must be of a level for which you have tek skill slots.

```
```

### Tekcasting Ability

Wisdom + Will is your Tekcasting ability for your scout tek skills, since your tek draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a tek skill refers to your Tekcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a scout tek skill you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Tek save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**Tek attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

### Scout Archetype

At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate: Hunter or Beast Master, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.

\page

### Scout Drone

Beginning at 3rd level, you can deploy a Scout Drone that lasts 10 minutes. It is spherical in shape, about 1 inch in diameter. It gets +5 to Stealth checks. As an action you can give the drone movement instructions through your datapad. As a bonus action you can view the drone's' camera and microphone feed through your datapad. After 10 minutes, the drone's battery dies, and unless in null-g, it falls to the ground. If the drone is destroyed, you must spend a long rest in order to repair it. Otherwise it becomes fully charged at the end of a short rest.

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Spacer Agility

Starting at 8th level, you take no movement penalty for moving in null gravity.

### Vanish

Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can't be tracked by nontek means, unless you choose to leave a trail.

### Keen Senses

At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can't see. When you attack a creature you can't see, your inability to see it doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.

You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't blinded or deafened.

### Foe Slayer

At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.

```
```

## Scout Archetypes

The ideal of the scout has three classic expressions: the Sharpshooter, Ranger, and Ghost.

### Sharpshooter

#### Sniper's Target

At 3rd level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

**_Assassin._** Your tenacity can wear down the most potent foes. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage if it's below its hit point maximum. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn.

**_Giant Killer._** When a Large or larger creature within 5 feet of you hits or misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to attack that creature immediately after its attack, provided that you can see the creature.

**_Horde Breaker._** Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target and within range of your weapon.

#### Defensive Tactics

At 7th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

**_Escape the Horde._** Opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage.

**_Volley._** You can use your action to make a ranged attack against any number of creatures within 10 feet of a point you can see within your weapon's range. You must have ammunition for each target, as normal, and you make a separate attack roll for each target.

**_Whirlwind Attack._** You can use your action to make a melee attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each target.

#### Superior Defense

At 15th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

**_Evasion._** When you are subjected to an effect, such as *lightning bolt* tek skill, that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

**_Stand Against the Tide._** When a hostile creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to repeat the same attack against another creature (other than itself) of your choice.

**_Uncanny Dodge._** When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.

\page

### Ranger

You are skilled in stealth and surviving far from the streets of a city, allowing you to scout ahead of your companions during expeditions. Scouts who embrace this archetype are at home in the wilderness and among brutes and scoundrels, and many Rangers serve as the eyes and ears of military squads. Ambusher, spy, bounty hunter — these are just a few of the roles that Rangers assume as they range the world.

#### Skirmisher
Starting at 3rd level, you are difficult to pin down during a fight. You can move up to half your speed as a reaction when an enemy ends its turn within 5 feet of you. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

#### Survivalist

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Science and Survival skills if you don't already have it. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of those proficiencies.

#### Superior Mobility
At 9th level, your walking speed increases by 10 feet. If you have a climbing or swimming speed, this increase applies to that speed as well.

#### Ambush Master

Starting at 13th level, you excel at leading ambushes and acting first in a fight.

You have advantage on initiative rolls. In addition, the first creature you hit during the first round of a combat becomes easier for you and others to strike; attack rolls against that target have advantage until the start of your next turn.

#### Sudden Strike

Starting at 17th level, you can strike with deadly speed. If you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make one additional attack as a bonus action. This attack also triggers your Extra Attack feature.

```
```

### Ghost

Ghosts specialize in stalking through the shadows

#### Ghost Magic
Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Ghost Tek Skills table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of scout tek skills you know.

#### Ghost Tek Skills

| Scout Level | Spell |
|------------------|--------------------|
| 3rd  | disguise self |
| 5th  | rope trick |
| 9th  | fear |
| 13th  | greater invisibility
| 17th  | seeming |


#### Ambusher

At 3rd level, you master the art of the ambush. You can give yourself a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Wisdom modifier.

At the start of your first turn of each combat, your walking speed increases by 10 feet, which lasts until the end of that turn. If you take the Attack action on that turn, you can make one additional weapon attack as part of that action. If that attack hits, the target takes an extra 1d8 damage of the weapon's damage type.

#### Spectral Sight

At 3rd level, you have obtained specter goggles. You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision from your race, its range increases by 30 feet.

You are also adept at evading creatures that rely on darkvision. While in darkness, you are invisible to any creature that relies on darkvision to see you in that darkness.

#### Iron Mind

By 7th level, you have honed your ability to resist the mind-altering powers of your prey. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency in Intelligence or Charisma saving throws (your choice).

#### Stalker's Flurry
At 11th level, you learn to attack with such unexpected speed that you can turn a miss into another strike. Once on each of your turns when you miss with a weapon attack, you can make another weapon attack as part of the same action.

#### Shadowy Dodge
Starting at 15th level, you can dodge in unforeseen ways, with wisps of supernatural shadow around you. Whenever a creature makes an attack roll against you and doesn't have advantage on the roll, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on it. You must use this feature before you know the outcome of the attack roll.

\page

## Martial Archetypes

Different soldiers choose different approaches to perfecting their fighting prowess. The martial archetype you choose to emulate reflects your approach. There are three archetypes: Champion, Assault Specialist, and Duelist.

### Champion

The archetypal Champion focuses on the development of raw physical power honed to deadly perfection. Those who model themselves on this archetype combine rigorous training with physical excellence to deal devastating blows.

Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.

#### Remarkable Athlete

Starting at 7th level, you can add half your proficiency bonus (round up) to any Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution check you make that doesn't already use your proficiency bonus.

In addition, when you make a running long jump, the distance you can cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Strength modifier.

The Assault Specialist focuses on supporting their squad. The assault specialist is usually the anchor of any assault formation. Assault Specialists have a keen eye for battle tactics, and generally command the battle at range with a Rail Rifle.

#### Combat Superiority

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.

**Maneuvers.** You learn three maneuvers of your choice, which are detailed under “Maneuvers” below. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack.

You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th level. Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.

You gain another superiority die at 7th level and one more at 15th level.

**Saving Throws.** Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

**Commander's Strike**
When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one of your attacks and use a bonus action to direct one of your companions to strike.

The process of copying the tek skill into your ritual book takes 2 hours per level of the tek skill, and costs 50 gp per level. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the tek skill to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it.
