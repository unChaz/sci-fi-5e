# The Cryo-Emergent Handbook

## Introduction

Welcome to your new life! The Sol Commerce Authority (SCA) is responsible for reorienting all preserved Natural Humans into this new world.

Centuries ago it was common practice for terminally ill humans, or those with vast resources to facilitate the cryogenic preservation of their bodies to be revived when scientific advancement allowed.

SCA legislation HL-3404-C53 dictates that all cryogenically preserved pre-stack natural humans that have not been revived to be confiscated by the SCA. Your consciousness has been legally conscripted into indentured servitude to the SCA until you have paid off your contract.

You were not revived for one of the following reasons:

- Your sleeve was damaged and unsuitable to be revived.
- Your cryo insurance coverage was not comprehensive enough to cover the cost of sleeve repair.
- Your cryo insurance agency was waiting for your sleeve repair costs to become lower.
- The contract on your revival designated a date after HL-3404-C53 went into effect.

### Designation
At the time of emergence, all Cryo-Emergents, are given an eight digit alphanumeric designation beginning with ‘CE-’.

## Persona

SCA assesses each emergent for personality traits. Scores are given to each trait at a 1:1 ratio. Scores range between -2 and 4.

Personality traits were the results of a two decades long psychological study at the Ganymede Institute. These traits were determined to be the most core quantification of the natural human personality. These traits are completely independent of physical form, and represent the human mind.

| Trait | Description|
|:----:|:-------------|
| Wit  | Mental sharpness and inventiveness; keen intelligence. |
| Will  | Mental fortitude. This is the mind’s ability to resist tek effectrs, and mental stress. |
| Intelligence | The ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills. |
| Wisdom | The soundness of an action or decision with regard to the application of experience, knowledge, and good judgment. |

> ##### Artificial Intelligence
> The concept of Artificial Intelligence as it applies today is likely very different during your first life. AI as you know it does not exist. Any AI programs are under strict regulations to do only simple tasks.


```
```

## Sleeve

Thanks to modern cloning techniques, and the availability of confiscated human bodies, death no longer needs to be permanent.

Upon death, if your stack is recovered, you can purchase a new sleeve, or be provided one in the case of wrongful death, or if you are properly insured.

### Quality Control
All sleeves must be appraised by the **Board of Quality Control** to ensure buyer protection. Sleeves are appraised with the following traits:


| Trait | Description |
|:----:|:-------------|
|Strength |Physical strength |
|Dexterity | Agility, reflex, and balance |
|Charisma | Beauty, appearance |
|Constitution | Overall health |


## Skills
Average skill levels can be derived from these core Sleeve Traits, and Persona Traits to give you a better idea of the effectiveness of a sleeve. Each skill is a combination of 2 traits.

##### Skill Definition
| Skill | Trait Combinations |
|:----:|:-------------|
|Physique | Strength + Constitution |
|Acrobatics | Strength + Dexterity |
|Toughness | Constitution + Will |
|Intimidation | Strength + Wit |
|Medic | Will + Wisdom|
|Charm | Wit + Charisma|
|Stealth | Dexterity + Will|
|Perception | Wisdom + Wit|
|Computers | Wit + Intelligence|
|Performance | Dexterity + Charisma|
|Tinker | Dexterity + Intelligence|
|Pilot | Dexterity + Intelligence|
|Knowledge | Wisdom + Intelligence |
|Trickery | Dexterity + Wit|
|Investigation | Will + Intelligence|
|Insight | Charisma + Wisdom |
|Diplomacy | Intelligence + Charisma |
|Nature | Wisdom + Will |

\page

### Skill Difficulty
In order to be successful at the given task, you roll the die, and add your skill score to the number you rolled. If the number is equal or higher than the difficulty score of the task, you were successful.

| Difficulty | Minimum Rolls |
|:----:|:-------------|
|Very Easy|10|
|Easy|15|
|Medium|20|
|Hard|25|
|Very Hard|30|
|Nearly Impossible|35|

The person determining the difficulty might increment the number on the table based on environmental conditions that might make the task easier or more difficult.

## Tekcasting
 Major advancements in technology have enabled the use of seemingly supernatural powers. Some humans have the ability to use tekcasters, devices discovered from a derelict alien spacestation.

### Focus
The focus used by those casting tek skills is called a Tekcaster. The tekcaster is a device worn on the wrist and is connected to the fingers. Using a combination of hand movements, vocal commands, and material components, the tekcaster can be used to cast tek skills. One can wield a weapon while wearing a tekcaster, but the hand must be free to use it.

> ##### The two sources of Tek Skill
> #### Knowledge
> One method to cast tek skills is to learn how to use them. This often involves lots of studying and  memorization. Using this method, the sleeve you are in does not impact how effective you are at casting tek skills.
>
> Classes that use this type of tek are Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Warlock, and Wizard.
>
> #### Genetic Alteration
> Another way to cast tek skills is to be genetically modified to do so. This prevents you from having to memorize tek skills, but you must be equipped with an adequate sleeve that has been genetically modified.
>
> Usually sleeves with above average Charisma or Constitution are better suited to this type of casting.
>
> Classes that use this type of tek are Bards, Paladins, and Sorcerers.


```
```

### Willpower
Regardless of the method of tek casting, Willpower is always at the core of casting tek skills. When estimating a caster’s tek ability, you add the relevant ability score to your Will score to determine your Tekcasting power. The only exception is Bard, which uses their Wit and Charisma score since their tek is a form of performance.

Sleeve Market
All tier 1 quality sleeves are given basic genetic alterations. You merely need to specify which basic genetic alteration you desire, and a limited set of sleeves is presented for you to choose from.

Basic Genetic Alterations
(Free Upgrades)

Innate Tekcasting

Genetic Enhancements
(Premium Upgrades)

Enhanced Muscle Memory: +1 PHY
Thick Skinned: +1 CON
Integrated Synapses: +1 DEX
Curated Aesthetics: +1 CHA

Basic sleeve insurance does not cover genetic enhancements. You can upgrade for a cost to a maximum of +2 per trait.

|  Upgrades | Cost |
|:----:|:-------------|
|1| 50,000c|
|2| 90,000c|
|3| 130,000c|
|4| 160,000c|

Upgrades can be retained when transferring to a new sleeve, or a return of 80% of the upgrade cost will be returned to you.

## Feats
At every 4 stack levels the Board of Quality Control awards employees with a free stack or sleeve upgrade. These upgrades come in a form of a predefined “feat” or a genetic alteration or stack data upload.
A list of available feats can be provided upon request.

Alternatively, you can be awarded 2 points to be allocated towards a genetic sleeve upgrade, or a data upload to your stack.

### Genetic Upgrade Option
Based on the type of genetic alteration (Physique, Constitution, Dexterity, Charisma), you will either be issued a new similar sleeve, or given genetic enhancements to your current sleeve. You may be given the option to choose.

### Data Upload Option
One unit of data uploaded to your stack will be guaranteed to be enough to increase your Wit, Will, Intelligence or Wisdom assessment score by 1 point.

## Sleeve Races

---

#### Racial Traits

The description of each race includes racial traits that are common to members of that race. The following entries appear among the traits of most races.

##### Ability Score Increase

Every race increases one or more of a character’s ability scores.

##### Age

The age entry notes the age when a member of the race is considered an adult, as well as the race’s expected lifespan. This information can help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game. You can choose any age for your character, which could provide an explanation for some of your ability scores. For example, if you play a young or very old character, your age could explain a particularly low Strength or Constitution score, while advanced age could account for a high Intelligence or Wisdom.

##### Alignment

Most races have tendencies toward certain alignments, described in this entry. These are not binding for player characters, but considering why your dwarf is chaotic, for example, in defiance of lawful dwarf society can help you better define your character.

##### Size

Characters of most races are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few races are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding heavy weapons, as explained in “Equipment.”

##### Speed

Your speed determines how far you can move when traveling (“Adventuring”) and fighting (“Combat”).

##### Languages

By virtue of your race, your character can speak, read, and write certain languages.

##### Subraces

Some races have subraces. Members of a subrace have the traits of the parent race in addition to the traits specified for their subrace. Relationships among subraces vary significantly from race to race and world to world.


```
```


### Human

#### Human Traits

It’s hard to make generalizations about humans, but your human character has these traits.

**_Ability Score Increase._** Two ability scores each increase by 1.

**_Age._** Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

**_Alignment._** Humans tend toward no particular alignment. The best and the worst are found among them.

**_Size._** Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

**_Speed._** Your base walking speed is 30 feet. **_Languages._** You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice.

Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects.

<!-- Classes -->
<!-- TODO -->

<!-- Backgrounds -->
\page
### Backgrounds

Every story has a beginning. Your character’s background reveals where you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the world. Your fighter might have been a courageous knight or a grizzled soldier. Your wizard could have been a sage or an artisan. Your rogue might have gotten by as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a jester.

Choosing a background provides you with important story cues about your character’s identity. The most important question to ask about your background is *what changed*? Why did you stop doing whatever your background describes and start adventuring? Where did you get the money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why don’t you have *more* money? How did you learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share your background?

The sample backgrounds in this chapter provide both concrete benefits (features, proficiencies, and languages) and roleplaying suggestions.

##### Proficiencies

Each background gives a character proficiency in two skills (described in “Using Ability Scores”).

In addition, most backgrounds give a character proficiency with one or more tools (detailed in “Equipment”).

If a character would gain the same proficiency from two different sources, he or she can choose a different proficiency of the same kind (skill or tool) instead.

##### Languages

Some backgrounds also allow characters to learn additional languages beyond those given by race. See “Languages.”

##### Equipment

Each background provides a package of starting equipment. If you use the optional rule to spend coin on gear, you do not receive the starting equipment from your background.

##### Suggested Characteristics

A background contains suggested personal characteristics based on your background. You can pick characteristics, roll dice to determine them randomly, or use the suggestions as inspiration for characteristics of your own creation.

##### Customizing a Background

You might want to tweak some of the features of a background so it better fits your character or the campaign setting. To customize a background, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose any two skills, and choose a total of two tool proficiencies or languages from the sample backgrounds. You can either use the equipment package from your background or spend coin on gear as described in the equipment section. (If you spend coin, you can’t also take the equipment package suggested for your class.) Finally, choose two personality traits, one ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you can’t find a feature that matches your desired background, work with your GM to create one.

The business venture can be anything legal or illegal. You must fund the venture directly by investing credits and making the appropriate business connections. The success of the venture is determined by a number of appropriate ability checks determined by the DM. Results can range from capital gains/losses, earned/ruined business relationships, to even legal trouble, or disputes with elite houses/corporations. Once you make the proposal and appropriate connections, the length of the business venture, the difficulty, and potential outcomes will be determined by the DM.

<!-- Multiclassing -->
\page
### Multiclassing

Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options.

With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining a level in your current class. Your levels in all your classes are added together to determine your character level. For example, if you have three levels in wizard and two in fighter, you’re a 5th-level character.

As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of your original class with just a few levels in another class, or you might change course entirely, never looking back at the class you left behind. You might even start progressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to a single-class character of the same level, you’ll sacrifice some focus in exchange for versatility.

#### Prerequisites

To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your new one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For example, a barbarian who decides to multiclass into the druid class must have both Strength and Wisdom scores of 13 or higher. Without the full training that a beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in your new class, having a natural aptitude that is reflected by higher- than-average ability scores.

**Multiclassing Prerequisites (table)**

| Class     | Ability Score Minimum       |
|-----------|-----------------------------|
| Barbarian | Strength 3                 |
| Bard      | Charisma 3                 |
| Cleric    | Wisdom 3                   |
| Druid     | Wisdom 3                   |
| Fighter   | Strength 3 or Dexterity 3 |
| Monk      | Dexterity 3 and Wisdom 3  |
| Paladin   | Strength 3 and Charisma 3 |
| Ranger    | Dexterity 3 and Wisdom 3  |
| Rogue     | Dexterity 3                |
| Sorcerer  | Charisma 3                 |
| Warlock   | Charisma 3                 |
| Wizard    | Intelligence 3             |

#### Experience Points

The experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table, not your level in a particular class. So, if you are a cleric 6/fighter 1, you must gain enough XP to reach 8th level before you can take your second level as a fighter or your seventh level as a cleric.

#### Hit Points and Hit Dice

You gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a class only when you are a 1st-level character.

You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can simply pool them together. For example, both the fighter and the paladin have a d10, so if you are a paladin 5/fighter 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them separately. If you are a paladin 5/cleric 5, for example, you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d8 Hit Dice.

### Proficiency Bonus

Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table in chapter 1, not your level in a particular class. For example, if you are a fighter 3/rogue 2, you have the proficiency bonus of a 5th- level character, which is +3.

### Proficiencies

When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of new class’s starting proficiencies, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.

**Multiclassing Proficiencies (table)**

| Class     | Proficiencies Gained                                                                                       |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Barbarian | pulse shields, simple weapons, martial weapons                                                                   |
| Bard      | Light armor, one skill of your choice, one musical instrument of your choice                               |
| Cleric    | Light armor, medium armor                                                                        |
| Druid     | Light armor, medium armor (druids will not wear armor)             |
| Fighter   | Light armor, medium armor, pulse shields, simple weapons, martial weapons                                        |
| Monk      | Simple weapons, ion blades                                                                                |
| Paladin   | Light armor, medium armor, pulse shields, simple weapons, martial weapons                                        |
| Ranger    | Light armor, medium armor, pulse shields, simple weapons, martial weapons, one skill from the class’s skill list |
| Rogue     | Light armor, one skill from the class’s skill list, thieves’ tools                                         |
| Sorcerer  | —                                                                                                          |
| Warlock   | Light armor, simple weapons                                                                                |
| Wizard    | —                                                                                                          |

#### Class Features

When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don’t, however, receive the class’s starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you’re multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Tekcasting.

##### Channel Divinity

If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn’t give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.

##### Extra Attack

If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don’t add together. You can’t make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter’s version of Extra Attack does). Similarly, the warlock’s eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn’t give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.

##### Unarmored Defense

If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can’t gain it again from another class.

##### Tekcasting

Your capacity for Tekcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your Tekcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Tekcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Tekcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

**_Tek Skills Known and Prepared._** You determine what tek skills you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1st-level ranger tek skills based on your levels in the ranger class. As 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your tek skill datapad contains ten wizard tek skills, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level tek skills. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard tek skills from your tek skill datapad.

Each tek skill you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the Tekcasting ability of that class when you cast the tek skill. Similarly, a Tekcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the tek skills from the class associated with that focus.

**_Tek Slots._** You determine your available tek skill slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, and half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes. Use this total to determine your tek skill slots by consulting the Multiclass Tekcaster table.

If you have more than one Tekcasting class, this table might give you tek skill slots of a level that is higher than the tek skills you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level tek skills. If a lower-level tek skill that you cast, like _burning hands_, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don’t have any tek skills of that higher level.

For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your tek skill slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don’t know any 3rd-level tek skills, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger tek skills. You can use the tek skill slots of those levels to cast the tek skills you do know—and potentially enhance their effects.

**_Pact Tek._** If you have both the Tekcasting class feature and the Pact Tek class feature from the warlock class, you can use the tek skill slots you gain from the Pact Tek feature to cast tek skills you know or have prepared from classes with the Tekcasting class feature, and you can use the tek skill slots you gain from the Tekcasting class feature to cast warlock tek skills you know.

<!-- Leveling Up -->
\page
## Beyond 1st Level

---

As your character goes on adventures and overcomes challenges, he or she gains experience, represented by experience points. A character who reaches a specified experience point total advances in capability. This advancement is called **gaining a level**.

When your character gains a level, his or her class often grants additional features, as detailed in the class description. Some of these features allow you to increase your ability scores, either increasing two scores by 1 each or increasing one score by 2. You can’t increase an ability score above 20. In addition, every character’s proficiency bonus increases at certain levels.

Each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die. Roll that Hit Die, add your Constitution modifier to the roll, and add the total to your hit point maximum. Alternatively, you can use the fixed value shown in your class entry, which is the average result of the die roll (rounded up).

When your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained. For example, if your 7th-level fighter has a Constitution score of 18, when he reaches 8th level, he increases his Constitution score from 17 to 18, thus increasing his Constitution modifier from +3 to +4. His hit point maximum then increases by 8.

The Character Advancement table summarizes the XP you need to advance in levels from level 1 through level 20, and the proficiency bonus for a character of that level. Consult the information in your character’s class description to see what other improvements you gain at each level.

**Character Advancement (table)**

| Experience Points | Level | Proficiency Bonus |

## Equipment

---

Currency is mostly dealt with in digital credits, however coins are still in circulation.

With one 100 credits, a character can buy a bedroll, 50 carbon fiber rope, or a low end datapad. A skilled (but not exceptional) worker can earn 100 credits a day.

50 credits buys a laborer’s work for half a day, a night in a low end hostel, or a few rounds of drinks at a pub.

A single credit buys a pack of gum, small flashlight, or a bottle of water.

Coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.

**Standard Exchange Rates (table)**

| Coin          | Credits |
|---------------|-------|
| Copper (cp)   | 1     |
| Silver (sp)   | 10    |
| Gold (gp)     | 100   |
| Platinum (pp) | 1,000 |

### Selling Loot

Opportunities abound to find loot, equipment, weapons, armor, and more in the dungeons you explore. Normally, you can sell your loot and trinkets when you return to a town or other colony, provided that you can find buyers and merchants interested in your loot.

**_Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment._** As a general rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch half their cost when sold in a market. Weapons and armor used by raiders are rarely in good enough condition to sell.

**_Alien Artifacts._** Selling alien artifacts is problematic. Finding someone to buy a potion or a scroll isn’t too hard, but other items are out of the realm of most but the wealthiest nobles. Likewise, aside from a few common alien artifacts, you won’t normally come across alien artifacts or tek skills to purchase. The value of tek is far beyond simple gold and should always be treated as such.

**_Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects._** These items retain their full value in the marketplace, and you can either trade them in for coin or use them as currency for other transactions. For exceptionally valuable loot, the GM might require you to find a buyer in a large town or larger community first.

**_Trade Goods._** In the black abyss, many people conduct transactions through barter. Like gems and art objects, trade rare minerals, water, livestock, and so on—retain their full value in the market and can be used as currency.

<!-- Armor -->

### Armor

Fantasy gaming worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many different cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from Flak armor to scarab skin to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and separates them into three categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor with A Pulse Shields.

The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor worn in futuristic gaming worlds.

**_Armor Proficiency._** Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap A Pulse Shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor’s use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can’t cast tek skills.

**_Armor Class (AC)._** Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class.

**_Heavy Armor._** Heavier armor interferes with the wearer’s ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows “Str 13” or “Str 15” in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the wearer’s speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.

**_Stealth._** If the Armor table shows “Disadvantage” in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

**_Pulse Shields._** A Pulse Shields is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding A Pulse Shields increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.

#### Light Armor

Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.

**_flak armor._** Lightweight metal lined combat armor.

**_pulse armor._** Powered by a small generator, this expensive shielding deflects projectiles. Once depleted it takes time to recharge. Pulse armor can be quite expensive, but ideal if you are trying to keep a low profile.

#### Medium Armor

Medium armor offers more protection than light armor, but it also impairs movement more. If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.

**_scarab skin._** Made of interlocking metal rings, a scarab skin is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This armor offers modest protection to the wearer’s upper body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against one another to be muffled by outer layers.

**_kevlar._** Basic military issue combat armor.

#### Heavy Armor

Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk.

Heavy armor doesn’t let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn’t penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative.

**_Power Shell._** Heavy and cumbersome, this powered mech armor gives the wearer enhanced strength, and a tough shell more resistant to damage than the standard pulse armor. However it makes it very difficult to be stealthy. This armor gives the wearer +2 Strength.

| Power Shell              | 1,50000 credits | 18                        | Str 15   | Disadvantage | 650 kg. |10/5 minutes |
| **_Shield_**       |          |                           |          |              |        ||
| Pulse Shield             | 10000 credits    | +2                        | —        | —            | 6 kg.  |1 action|


#### Getting Into and Out of Armor

The time it takes to don or doff armor depends on the armor’s category.

**_Don._** This is the time it takes to put on armor. You benefit from the armor’s AC only if you take the full time to don the suit of armor.

**_Doff._** This is the time it takes to take off armor. If you have help, reduce this time by half.

### Weapons

Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class’s focus and the tools you are most likely to use. Whether you favor a pulse blade or a rail rifle, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring.

The Weapons table shows the most common weapons used in the futuristic gaming worlds, their price and weight, the damage they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. Every weapon is classified as either melee or ranged. A **melee weapon** is used to attack a target within 5 feet of you, whereas a **ranged weapon** is used to attack a target at a distance.

#### Weapon Proficiency

Your race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The two categories are **simple** and **martial**. Most people can use simple weapons with proficiency. These weapons include clubs, maces, and other weapons often found in the hands of commoners. Martial weapons, including swords and axes, require more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial weapons because these weapons put their fighting style and training to best use.

Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.

## Weapon Types

### Ion Weapons

Straight bladed weapons forged with modern day technology are much stronger than the steel blades once used on Earth. Their molecular structure makes them better for getting through weaker pulse armor.

### Pulse Weapons

Powered melee weapons designed to puncture through modern armor.

#### Weapon Properties

Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.

**_Ammunition._** You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Once your clip runs out of ammunition, you have to spend an action to reload.

If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see “Improvised Weapons” later in the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

**_Finesse._** When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

**_Heavy._** Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon’s size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively. Light. A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

**_Burst-Fire._** Weapons with this trait fire multiple rounds of ammunition per round. You roll once to hit, but roll damage separately for each round of ammunition.

**_Loading._** Weapons with this trait need to be reloaded after firing a certain number of times. For example a Rail Rifle fires 3 rounds of ammunition per round, and requires to be reloaded every 10 shots, meaning its clips hold 30 rounds of ammunition.

**_Range._** A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon’s long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can’t attack a target beyond the weapon’s long range.

**_Reach._** This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

**_Special._** A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon’s description (see “Special Weapons” later in this section).

**_Thrown._** If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw an ion dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the ion dagger has the finesse property.

**_Two-Handed._** This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

**_Versatile._** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

**_Hidden._** This weapon can be disguised as an ordinary object with a Stealth check. It takes a bonus action to unsheathe.

##### Improvised Weapons

Sometimes characters don’t have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead goblin.

Often, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the GM’s option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.

An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the GM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.

\page

##### Special Weapons

Weapons with special rules are described here.

**_Razer._** This weapon can be toggled between whip form and rapier form using a bonus action. As a rapier it is a Finesse weapon that does 1d8 piercing. As a whip it has Reach, and does 1d4 slashing.

**_Pulse Fist._** Has advantage on targets using Pulse Shielding.

**_Pulse Net._** A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 concussive damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net.

When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

### Adventuring Gear

This section describes items that have special rules or require further explanation.

**_Grenade._** Throw at a location within 30 feet. Creatures within 5 feet must make a dexterity 14 saving throw or take damage based on the grenade's type. Types: Incendiary, Radiation, Cryo,

**_Antitoxin._** A creature that drinks this vial of liquid gains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to undead or constructs.

**_Book._** A book might contain poetry, historical accounts, information pertaining to a particular field of lore, diagrams and notes on gnomish contraptions, or just about anything else that can be represented using text or pictures. A book of tek skills is a tek skill datapad (described later in this section).

**_Caltrops._** As an action, you can spread a bag of caltrops to cover a square area that is 5 feet on a side. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving this turn and take 1 piercing damage. Taking this damage reduces the creature’s walking speed by 10 feet until the creature regains at least 1 hit point. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn’t need to make the save.

**_Chain._** A chain has 10 hit points. It can be burst with a successful DC 20 Strength check.

**_Climber’s Kit._** A climber’s kit includes special pitons, boot tips, gloves, and a harness. You can use the climber’s kit as an action to anchor yourself; when you do, you can’t fall more than 25 feet from the point where you anchored yourself, and you can’t climb more than 25 feet away from that point without undoing the anchor.

**_Fishing Tackle._** This kit includes a wooden rod, silken line, corkwood bobbers, steel hooks, lead sinkers, velvet lures, and nbullet netting.
Healer’s Kit. This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check.

**_Hunting Trap._** When you use your action to set it, this trap forms a saw-toothed steel ring that snaps shut when a creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage and stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals 1 piercing damage to the trapped creature.

**_Flashlight._** A flashlight casts bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a battery.

**_Lock._** A key is provided with the lock. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves’ tools can pick this lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Your GM may decide that better locks are available for higher prices.

**_Magnifying Glass._** This lens allows a closer look at small objects. It is also useful as a substitute for flint and steel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass requires light as bright as sunlight to focus, tinder to ignite, and about 5 minutes for the fire to ignite. A magnifying glass grants advantage on any ability check made to appraise or inspect an item that is small or highly detailed.

**_Manacles._** These metal restraints can bind a Small or Medium creature. Escaping the manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. Breaking them requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. Each set of manacles comes with one key. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves’ tools can pick the manacles’ lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Manacles have 15 hit points.

**_Mess Kit._** This tin box contains a cup and simple cutlery. The box clamps together, and one side can be used as a cooking pan and the other as a plate or shallow bowl.

**_Poison, Basic._** You can use the poison in this vial to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammunition must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying.

**_Potion of Healing._** A character who drinks the tek red fluid in this vial regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. Drinking or administering a potion takes an action.

**_Pouch._** A cloth or leather pouch can hold up to 20 sling bullets or 50 blowgun needles, among other things. A compartmentalized pouch for holding tek skill components is called a component pouch (described earlier in this section). Quiver. A quiver can hold up to 20 bullets.
Ram, Portable. You can use a portable ram to break down doors. When doing so, you gain a +4 bonus on the Strength check. One other character can help you use the ram, giving you advantage on this check.

**_Rations._** Rations consist of dry foods suitable for extended travel, including jerky, dried fruit, hardtack, and nuts.

**_Rope._** Rope, whether made of hemp or silk, has 2 hit points and can be burst with a DC 17 Strength check.

**_tekcaster._** Implement with which tek skills are cast.

**_Tent._** A simple and portable canvas shelter, a tent sleeps two.

### Tools

A tool helps you to do something you couldn't otherwise do, such as craft or repair an item, forge a document, or pick a lock. Your race, class, background, or feats give you proficiency with certain tools. Proficiency with a tool allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make using that tool. Tool use is not tied to a single ability, since proficiency with a tool represents broader knowledge of its use. For example, the GM might ask you to make a Dexterity check to carve a fine detail with your woodcarver’s tools, or a Strength check to make something out of particularly hard wood.

## Tinker’s Tools

These special tools include the items needed to pursue a craft or trade. The table shows examples of the most common types of tools, each providing items related to a single craft. Proficiency with a set of artisan's tools lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make using the tools in your craft. Each type of artisan's tools requires a separate proficiency. Using Tinker’s tools you can repair electronic and mechanical devices with an ability check.

## Disguise Kit

A device in the shape of a mask that injects gel into your face to change your appearance. The gel can be removed by using the disguise kit. After 24 hours the gem must be reapplied or it loses its form.

Gaming Set. A small box containing VR optics and haptic gloves for non-immersive VR gaming. It also contains either a set of dice, deck of playing cards, or a chess set.

## Botanist’s Kit
This kit contains a variety of instruments such as clippers, mortar and pestle, and pouches and vials used by herbalists to create remedies and potions. It also contains a specialized datapad that can be used to identify plants. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to identify or apply herbs. Also, proficiency with this kit is required to create antitoxin and potions of healing.

## Musical Instrument

Several of the most common types of musical instruments are shown on the table as examples. If you have proficiency with a given musical instrument, you can add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to play music with the instrument. Each type of musical instrument requires a separate proficiency.

## Navigator's Kit

This specialized datapad is used for navigation in space. Proficiency with navigator's tools lets you chart a ship's course and follow navigation charts. In addition, it allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make to avoid getting lost in space. In the event that a ship’s navigation data is out of date or offline, you can override the navigation controls from the ship’s helm using this device. You can update the star charts on your Navigator’s Datapad at most colonies and stations.

## Poisoner's Kit
A poisoner's kit includes the vials, chemicals, and other equipment necessary for the creation of poisons. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to craft or use poisons.

## Thieves' Tools
This set of tools includes a datapad, a small file, a set of lock picks, a small mirror mounted on a metal handle, a set of narrow-bladed scissors, and a pair of pliers.

### Expenses

When not descending into the depths of space, exploring ruins for lost loot, or waging war against the encroaching darkness, adventurers face more mundane realities. Even in a futuristic world, people require basic necessities such as shelter, sustenance, and clothing. These things cost money, although some lifestyles cost more than others.

#### Lifestyle Expenses

Lifestyle expenses provide you with a simple way to account for the cost of living in a futuristic world. They cover your accommodations, food and drink, and all your other necessities. Furthermore, expenses cover the cost of maintaining your equipment so you can be ready when adventure next calls.

At the start of each week or month (your choice), choose a lifestyle from the Expenses table and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle. The prices listed are per day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of your chosen lifestyle over a thirty-day period, multiply the listed price by 30. Your lifestyle might change from one period to the next, based on the funds you have at your disposal, or you might maintain the same lifestyle throughout your character’s career.

Your lifestyle choice can have consequences. Maintaining a wealthy lifestyle might help you make contacts with the rich and powerful, though you run the risk of attracting thieves. Likewise, living frugally might help you avoid criminals, but you are unlikely to make powerful connections.

**Lifestyle Expenses (table)**

| Lifestyle    | Price/Day     |
|--------------|---------------|
| Wretched     | —             |
| Squalid      | 1000 credits         |
| Poor         | 2000 credits         |
| Modest       | 100 credits          |
| Comfortable  | 200 credits          |
| Wealthy      | 400 credits          |
| Aristocratic | 1000 credits minimum |

**_Wretched._** You live in inhumane conditions. With no place to call home, you shelter wherever you can, Stealthing into barns, huddling in old crates, and relying on the good graces of people better off than you. A wretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched people covet your armor, weapons, and adventuring gear, which represent a fortune by their standards. You are beneath the notice of most people.

**_Squalid._** You live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut just outside town, or a vermin-infested boarding house in the worst part of town. You have shelter from the elements, but you live in a desperate and often violent environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and misfortune. You are beneath the notice of most people, and you have few legal protections. Most people at this lifestyle level have suffered some terrible setback. They might be disturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer from disease.

**_Poor._** A poor lifestyle means going without the comforts available in a stable community. Simple food and lodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant, experience. Your accommodations might be a room in a flophouse or in the common room above a tavern. You benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to contend with violence, crime, and disease. People at this lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, costermongers, peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and other disreputable types.

**_Modest._** A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums and ensures that you can maintain your equipment. You live in an older part of town, renting a room in a boarding house, inn, or temple. You don’t go hungry or thirsty, and your living conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary people living modest lifestyles include soldiers with families, laborers, students, priests, hedge wizards, and the like.

**_Comfortable._** Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily maintain your equipment. You live in a small cottage in a middle-class neighborhood or in a private room at a fine inn. You associate with merchants, skilled tradespeople, and military officers.

**_Wealthy._** Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a life of luxury, though you might not have achieved the social status associated with the old money of nobility or royalty. You live a lifestyle comparable to that of a highly successful merchant, a favored servant of the royalty, or the owner of a few small businesses. You have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a good part of town or a comfortable suite at a fine inn. You likely have a small staff of servants.

**_Aristocratic._** You live a life of plenty and comfort. You move in circles populated by the most powerful people in the community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps a townhouse in the nicest part of town or rooms in the finest inn. You dine at the best restaurants, retain the most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants attending to your every need. You receive invitations to the social gatherings of the rich and powerful, and spend evenings in the company of politicians, guild leaders, high priests, and nobility. You must also contend with the highest levels of deceit and treachery. The wealthier you are, the greater the chance you will be drawn into political intrigue as a pawn or participant.

> ##### Self-Sufficiency
>
> The expenses and lifestyles described here assume that you are spending your time between adventures in town, availing yourself of whatever services you can afford—paying for food and shelter, paying townspeople to sharpen your sword and repair your armor, and so on. Some characters, though, might prefer to spend their time away from civilization, sustaining themselves in the wild by hunting, foraging, and repairing their own gear.
>
> Maintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn’t require you to spend any coin, but it is time-consuming. If you spend your time between adventures practicing a profession, you can eke out the equivalent of a poor lifestyle. Proficiency in the Nature skill lets you live at the equivalent of a comfortable lifestyle.

#### Food, Drink, and Lodging

The Food, Drink, and Lodging table gives prices for individual food items and a single night’s lodging. These prices are included in your total lifestyle expenses.

**Food, Drink, and Lodging (table)**

| Item                     | Cost  |
|--------------------------|-------|
| **_Ale_**                |       |

| - Fine (bottle)          | 200 credits |

#### Services

Adventurers can pay nonplayer characters to assist them or act on their behalf in a variety of circumstances. Most such hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while others are masters of a craft or art, and a few are experts with specialized adventuring skills.

Some of the most basic types of hirelings appear on the Services table. Other common hirelings include any of the wide variety of people who inhabit a typical town or city, when the adventurers pay them to perform a specific task. For example, a wizard might pay a carpenter to construct an elaborate chest (and its miniature replica) for use in the *secret chest* tek skill. A fighter might commission a blacksmith to forge a special sword. A bard might pay a tailor to make exquisite clothing for an upcoming performance in front of the duke.

Other hirelings provide more expert or dangerous services. Mercenary soldiers paid to help the adventurers take on a hobgoblin army are hirelings, as are sages hired to research ancient or esoteric lore. If a high-level adventurer establishes a stronghold of some kind, he or she might hire a whole staff of servants and agents to run the place, from a castellan or steward to menial laborers to keep the stables clean. These hirelings often enjoy a long-term contract that includes a place to live within the stronghold as part of the offered compensation.

Skilled hirelings include anyone hired to perform a service that involves a proficiency (including weapon, tool, or skill): a mercenary, artisan, scribe, and so on. The pay shown is a minimum; some expert hirelings require more pay. Untrained hirelings are hired for menial work that requires no particular skill and can include laborers, porters, maids, and similar workers.

**Services (table)**

| Service Pay       | Pay           |

| **_Coach cab_**   |               |

| **_Hireling_**    |               |
| - Skilled         | 200 credits per day  |

#### Tekcasting Services

People who are able to cast tek skills don’t fall into the category of ordinary hirelings. It might be possible to find someone willing to cast a tek skill in exchange for coin or favors, but it is rarely easy and no established pay rates exist. As a rule, the higher the level of the desired tek skill, the harder it is to find someone who can cast it and the more it costs.

Hiring someone to cast a relatively common tek skill of 1st or 2nd level, such as *cure wounds* or *identify*, is easy enough in a city or town, and might cost 10 to 50 gold pieces (plus the cost of any expensive material components). Finding someone able and willing to cast a higher-level tek skill might involve traveling to a large city, perhaps one with a university or prominent temple. Once found, the tekcaster might ask for a service instead of payment—the kind of service that only adventurers can provide, such as retrieving a rare item from a dangerous locale or traversing a monster-infested wilderness to deliver something important to a distant colony.

<!-- Feats -->

## Feats

---

A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides.

At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat’s description says otherwise.

You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat’s prerequisite, you can’t use that feat until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Grappler feat requires you to have a Strength of 13 or higher. If your Strength is reduced below 13 somehow—perhaps by a withering hack—you can’t benefit from the Grappler feat until your Strength is restored.

#### ATHLETE
You have undergone extensive physical training to gain the following benefits:
- Increase your Physique or Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

#### CHARGER
When you use your action to Dash, you can use a bonus action to make one melee weapon attack or to shove a creature. If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line immediately before taking this bonus action, you either gain a +5 bonus to the attack’s damage roll (if you chose to make a melee attack and hit) or push the target up to 10 feet away from you (if you chose to shove and you succeed).

*Prerequisite: Intelligence, Will or Wisdom 13 or higher*

You have learned a number of tek skills that you can cast as rituals. These tek skills are written in a ritual book, which you must have in hand while casting one of them.

When you choose this feat, you acquire a ritual book holding two 1st-level tek skills of your choice. Choose one of the following classes: bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard. You must choose your tek skills from that class’s tek skill list, and the tek skills you choose must have the ritual tag.

<!-- Core Mechanics -->
\page
### Advantage and Disadvantage

Sometimes a special ability or tek skill tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll. When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.

If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don’t roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.

If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.

You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, or tek skills. Inspiration can also give a character advantage. The

GM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.

### Proficiency Bonus

Characters have a proficiency bonus determined by level. Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.

Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when you make the save.

Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. For example, the rogue’s Expertise feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability checks. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and multiply or divide it only once.

By the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn’t normally benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don’t add the bonus to the check. For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if you lack proficiency in the History skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence (History) checks.

In general, you don’t multiply your proficiency bonus for attack rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect allows you to do so, these same rules apply.

#### Contests

Sometimes one character’s or monster’s efforts are directly opposed to another’s. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a tek ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal— for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.

Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding.

If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that the door remains shut.

##### Attack Rolls and Damage

You add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as a scorcher, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand* to-hand combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack.

##### Lifting and Carrying

Your Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.

**_Carrying Capacity._** Your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that most characters don’t usually have to worry about it.

**_Push, Drag, or Lift._** You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.

**_Size and Strength._** Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the creature’s carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.

##### Variant: Encumbrance

The rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple. Here is a variant if you are looking for more detailed rules for determining how a character is hindered by the weight of equipment. When you use this variant, ignore the Strength column of the Armor table.

If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are **encumbered**, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.

If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are instead **heavily encumbered**, which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.


##### Armor Class

Depending on the armor you wear, you might add some or all of your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class.

##### Initiative

At the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making a Dexterity check. Initiative determines the order of creatures’ turns in combat.

> #### Hiding
>
> The DM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check’s total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.
>
>You can’t hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase.
>
>An invisible creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.
>
>In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the DM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.
>
> **_Passive Perception._** When you hide, there’s a chance someone will notice you even if they aren’t searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the DM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature’s Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. For example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 14.
>
> **_What Can You See?**_ One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be **lightly** or **heavily obscured**, as explained in chapter 8, “Adventuring.”

##### Hit Points

Your Toughness modifier contributes to your hit points. Typically, you add your Toughness modifier to each Hit Die you roll for your hit points.

##### Tekcasting Ability

Bards, paladins, sorcerers, and warlocks use Charisma and Will as their Tekcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of tek skills they cast.

### Saving Throws

A saving throw—also called a save—represents an attempt to resist a tek skill, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don’t normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one because your character or monster is at risk of harm.

To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. For example, you use your Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity saving throw.

A saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and can be affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined by the GM.

Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The wizard, for example, is proficient in Intelligence saves. As with skill proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or her proficiency bonus to saving throws made using a particular ability score. Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well.

The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a tek skill is determined by the caster’s Tekcasting ability and proficiency bonus.

The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in the effect that allows the save. Usually, a successful save means that a creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.

### Time

In situations where keeping track of the passage of time is important, the GM determines the time a task requires. The GM might use a different time scale depending on the context of the situation at hand. In a dungeon environment, the adventurers’ movement happens on a scale of **minutes**. It takes them about a minute to creep down a long hallway, another minute to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes to search the chamber beyond for anything interesting or valuable.

In a city or wilderness, a scale of **hours** is often more appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower at the heart of the forest hurry across those fifteen miles in just under four hours’ time.

For long journeys, a scale of **days** works best.

Following the road from Baldur’s Gate to Waterdeep, the adventurers spend four uneventful days before a goblin ambush interrupts their journey.

In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on **rounds**, a 6-second span of time.

### Movement

Swimming across a rushing river, Stealthing down a dungeon corridor, scaling a treacherous mountain slope—all sorts of movement play a key role in futuristic gaming adventures.

The GM can summarize the adventurers’ movement without calculating exact distances or travel times: “You travel through the forest and find the dungeon entrance late in the evening of the third day.” Even in a dungeon, particularly a large dungeon or a cave network, the GM can summarize movement between encounters: “After killing the guardian at the entrance to the ancient dwarven stronghold, you consult your map, which leads you through miles of echoing corridors to a chasm bridged by a nbullet stone arch.”

Sometimes it’s important, though, to know how long it takes to get from one spot to another, whether the answer is in days, hours, or minutes. The rules for determining travel time depend on two factors: the speed and travel pace of the creatures moving and the terrain they’re moving over.

#### Speed

Every character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in feet that the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life* threatening situation.

The following rules determine how far a character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.

##### Travel Pace

While traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to Stealth around and to search an area more carefully.

**_Forced March._** The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.

For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion (see appendix A).

**_Mounts and Vehicles._** For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.

Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel, and they don’t suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.

Certain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, or special vehicles, such as a *carpet of flying*, allow you to travel more swiftly.

**Travel Pace (table)**

| Pace   | Distance per: Minute | Hour    | Day      | Effect                                           |
|--------|----------------------|---------|----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Fast   | 400 feet             | 4 miles | 30 miles | −5 penalty to passive Wisdom (Perception) scores |
| Normal | 300 feet             | 3 miles | 18 miles | —                                                |
| Slow   | 200 feet             | 2 miles | 24 miles | Able to use stealth                              |

##### Difficult Terrain

The travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear dungeon corridors. But adventurers often face dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep mountains, and ice-covered ground—all considered difficult terrain.

You move at half speed in difficult terrain— moving 1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed—so you can cover only half the normal distance in a minute, an hour, or a day.

#### Special Types of Movement

Movement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness areas often involves more than simply walking. Adventurers might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get where they need to go.

##### Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling

While climbing or swimming, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing or swimming speed. At the GM’s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds requires a successful Strength (Physique) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful Strength (Physique) check.

##### Jumping

Your Strength determines how far you can jump.

**_Long Jump._** When you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet up to your Strength score if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement.

This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn’t matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM’s option, you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Physique) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump’s distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.

When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.

**_High Jump._** When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to 3 + your Strength modifier if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. In some circumstances, your GM might allow you to make a Strength (Physique) check to jump higher than you normally can.

You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1½ times your height.

### The Environment

By its nature, adventuring involves delving into places that are dark, dangerous, and full of mysteries to be explored. The rules in this section cover some of the most important ways in which adventurers interact with the environment in such places.

#### Falling

A fall from a great height is one of the most common hazards facing an adventurer. At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. The creature lands prone, unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.

#### Suffocating

A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).

When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can’t regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.

For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points.

#### Vision and Light

The most fundamental tasks of adventuring— noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a tek skill, to name just a few—rely heavily on a character’s ability to see. Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.

A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a **lightly obscured** area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

A **heavily obscured** area—such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage—blocks vision entirely. A creature effectively suffers from the blinded condition (see appendix A) when trying to see something in that area.

The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.

**Bright light** lets most creatures see normally.

Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.

**Dim light**, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.

**Darkness** creates a heavily obscured area.

Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of tek darkness.

##### Blindsight

A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as oozes, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons, have this sense.

##### Darkvision

Many creatures in futuristic gaming worlds, especially those that dwell underground, have darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision can see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature is concerned. However, the creature can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

##### Truesight

A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and tek darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceives the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by tek. Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.

#### Food and Water

Characters who don’t eat or drink suffer the effects of exhaustion (see appendix A). Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can’t be removed until the character eats and drinks the full required amount.

##### Food

A character needs one pound of food per day and can make food last longer by subsisting on half rations. Eating half a pound of food in a day counts as half a day without food.

A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end of each day beyond that limit, a character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion.

A normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.

##### Water

A character needs one gallon of water per day, or two gallons per day if the weather is hot. A character who drinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion at the end of the day. A character with access to even less water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of the day.

If the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character takes two levels in either case.

#### Interacting with Objects

A character’s interaction with objects in an environment is often simple to resolve in the game. The player tells the GM that his or her character is doing something, such as moving a lever, and the GM describes what, if anything, happens.

For example, a character might decide to pull a lever, which might, in turn, raise a portcullis, cause a room to flood with water, or open a secret door in a nearby wall. If the lever is rusted in position, though, a character might need to force it. In such a situation, the GM might call for a Strength check to see whether the character can wrench the lever into place. The GM sets the DC for any such check based on the difficulty of the task.

Characters can also damage objects with their weapons and tek skills. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage, but otherwise they can be affected by physical and tek attacks much like creatures can. The GM determines an object’s Armor Class and hit points, and might decide that certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks. (It’s hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects always fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and they are immune to effects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks.

A character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object. The GM sets the DC for any such check.

### Resting

Heroic though they might be, adventurers can’t spend every hour of the day in the thick of exploration, social interaction, and combat. They need rest—time to sleep and eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds and spirits for Tekcasting, and brace themselves for further adventure.

Adventurers can take short rests in the midst of an adventuring day and a long rest to end the day.

#### Short Rest

A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.

A character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to the character’s maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character’s level. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character’s Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total. The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. A character regains some spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest, as explained below.

#### Long Rest

A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps or performs light activity: reading, talking, eating, or standing watch for no more than 2 hours. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity—at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting tek skills, or similar adventuring activity—the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it.

At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal to half of the character’s total number of them (minimum of one die). For example, if a character has eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain four spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest.

A character can’t benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.

<!-- Downtime -->
\page
### Between Adventures

Between trips to dungeons and battles against ancient evils, adventurers need time to rest, recuperate, and prepare for their next adventure. Many adventurers also use this time to perform other tasks, such as crafting arms and armor, performing research, or spending their hard-earned gold.

In some cases, the passage of time is something that occurs with little fanfare or description. When starting a new adventure, the GM might simply declare that a certain amount of time has passed and allow you to describe in general terms what your character has been doing. At other times, the GM might want to keep track of just how much time is passing as events beyond your perception stay in motion.

#### Lifestyle Expenses

Between adventures, you choose a particular quality of life and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle.

Living a particular lifestyle doesn’t have a huge effect on your character, but your lifestyle can affect the way other individuals and groups react to you. For example, when you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier for you to influence the nobles of the city than if you live in poverty.

#### Downtime Activities

Between adventures, the GM might ask you what your character is doing during his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can vary in duration, but each downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.

Downtime activities other than the ones presented below are possible. If you want your character to spend his or her downtime performing an activity not covered here, discuss it with your GM.

##### Crafting

You can craft nontek objects, including adventuring equipment and works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the object you are trying to create (typically artisan’s tools). You might also need access to special materials or locations necessary to create it. For example, someone proficient with smith’s tools needs a forge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor.

For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 500 credits, and you must expend raw materials worth half the total market value. If something you want to craft has a market value greater than 500 credits, you make progress every day in 5*00 credits increments until you reach the market value of the item. For example, a suit of plate armor (market value 1,50000 credits) takes 300 days to craft by yourself.

Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each character contributes 500 credits worth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a suit of plate armor in 100 days, at a total cost of 75000 credits.

While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 100 credits per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost.

##### Practicing a Profession

You can work between adventures, allowing you to maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 100 credits per day. This benefit lasts as long you continue to practice your profession.

If you are a member of an organization that can provide gainful employment, such as a temple or a thieves’ guild, you earn enough to support a comfortable lifestyle instead.

If you have proficiency in the Performance skill and put your performance skill to use during your downtime, you earn enough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead.

##### Recuperating

You can use downtime between adventures to recover from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison.

After three days of downtime spent recuperating, you can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, you can choose one of the following results:

* End one effect on you that prevents you from regaining hit points.
* For the next 24 hours, gain advantage on saving throws against one disease or poison currently affecting you.

##### Researching

The time between adventures is a great chance to perform research, gaining insight into mysteries that have unfurled over the course of the campaign. Research can include poring over dusty tomes and crumbling scrolls in a library or buying drinks for the locals to pry rumors and gossip from their lips.

When you begin your research, the GM determines whether the information is available, how many days of downtime it will take to find it, and whether there are any restrictions on your research (such as needing to seek out a specific individual, tome, or location). The GM might also require you to make one or more ability checks, such as an Intelligence (Investigation) check to find clues pointing toward the information you seek, or a Charisma (Charm) check to secure someone’s aid. Once those conditions are met, you learn the information if it is available.

For each day of research, you must spend 100 credits to cover your expenses. This cost is in addition to your normal lifestyle expenses.

##### Training

You can spend time between adventures learning a new language or training with a set of tools. Your GM might allow additional training options.

First, you must find an instructor willing to teach you. The GM determines how long it takes, and whether one or more ability checks are required.

The training lasts for 250 days and costs 100 credits per day. After you spend the requisite amount of time and money, you learn the new language or gain proficiency with the new tool.

<!-- Combat -->

## The Order of Combat

---

A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and Tekcasting. The game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A
**round** represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a **turn**. The order of turns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated the other.

> #### Combat Step by Step
>
> 1.  **Determine surprise.** The GM determines whether anyone involved in the combat encounter is surprised.
> 2.  **Establish positions.** The GM decides where all the characters and monsters are located. Given the adventurers’ marching order or their stated positions in the room or other location, the GM figures out where the adversaries are̶how far away and in what direction.
> 3.  **Roll initiative.** Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls initiative, determining the order of combatants’ turns.
> 4.  **Take turns.** Each participant in the battle takes a turn in initiative order.
> 5.  **Begin the next round.** When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until the fighting stops.

#### Surprise

A band of adventurers Stealths up on a bandit camp, springing from the trees to attack them. A gelatinous cube glides down a dungeon passage, unnoticed by the adventurers until the cube engulfs one of them. In these situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the other.

The GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the GM compares the Dexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn’t notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.

If you’re surprised, you can’t move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can’t take a reaction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren’t.

#### Initiative

Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every participant makes a Dexterity check to determine their place in the initiative order. The GM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same time.

The GM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with the lowest. This is the order (called the initiative order) in which they act during each round. The initiative order remains the same from round to round.

If a tie occurs, the GM decides the order among tied GM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the order among their tied characters. The GM can decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character. Optionally, the GM can have the tied characters and monsters each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest roll going first.

#### Your Turn

On your turn, you can **move** a distance up to your speed and **take one action**. You decide whether to move first or take your action first. Your speed— sometimes called your walking speed—is noted on your character sheet.

The most common actions you can take are described in the “Actions in Combat” section later in this chapter. Many class features and other abilities provide additional options for your action.

The “Movement and Position” section later in this chapter gives the rules for your move.

You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can’t decide what to do on your turn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, as described in “Actions in Combat.”

##### Bonus Actions

Various class features, tek skills, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action. The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows a rogue to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action only when a special ability, tek skill, or other feature of the game states that you can do something as a bonus action. You otherwise don’t have a bonus action to take.

You can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than one available.

You choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the bonus action’s timing is specified, and anything that deprives you of your ability to take actions also prevents you from taking a bonus action.

##### Other Activity on Your Turn

Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your action nor your move.

You can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.

You can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action. For example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.

If you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action. Some alien artifacts and other special objects always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.

The GM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the GM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.

#### Reactions

Certain special abilities, tek skills, and situations allow you to take a special action called a reaction. A reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else’s. The opportunity attack, described later in this chapter, is the most common type of reaction.

When you take a reaction, you can’t take another one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature’s turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the reaction.

### Movement and Position

In combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain the upper hand.

On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as much or as little of your speed as you like on your turn, following the rules here.

Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can constitute your entire move. However you’re moving, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done moving.

#### Breaking Up Your Move

You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move 10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.

##### Moving between Attacks

If you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you can break up your movement even further by moving between those attacks. For example, a fighter who can make two attacks with the Extra Attack feature and who has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, make an attack, move 15 feet, and then attack again.

##### Using Different Speeds

If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you’ve already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can’t use the new speed during the current move.

For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60 because a wizard cast the *fly* tek skill on you, you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, and then leap into the air to fly 30 feet more.

#### Difficult Terrain

Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains. Boulder-strewn caverns, briar* choked forests, treacherous staircases—the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.

Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.

Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.

#### Being Prone

Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they are prone, a condition described in appendix A.

You can **drop prone** without using any of your speed. **Standing up** takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend

15 feet of movement to stand up. You can’t stand up if you don’t have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.

To move while prone, you must **crawl** or use tek such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of movement.

### Interacting with Objects Around You

Here are a few examples of the sorts of thing you can do in tandem with your movement and action:

* draw or sheathe a sword
* open or close a door
* withdraw a potion from your backpack
* pick up a dropped axe
* take a bauble from a table
* remove a ring from your finger
* stuff some food into your mouth
* plant a banner in the ground
* fish a few coins from your belt pouch
* drink all the ale in a flagon
* throw a lever or a switch
* pull a torch from a sconce
* take a book from a shelf you can reach
* extinguish a small flame
* don a mask
* pull the hood of your cloak up and over your head
* put your ear to a door
* kick a small stone
* turn a key in a lock
* tap the floor with a 10-foot pole
* hand an item to another character

#### Moving Around Other Creatures

You can move through a nonhostile creature’s space. In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature’s space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature’s space is difficult terrain for you.

Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can’t willingly end your move in its space.

If you leave a hostile creature’s reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity attack, as explained later in the chapter.

#### Flying Movement

Flying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but they must also deal with the danger of falling. If a flying creature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held aloft by tek, such as by the *fly* tek skill.

#### Null Gravity
While moving in null gravity you must make an Acrobatics ability check determine success. If you aren't careful you can miss, undershoot, or overshoot and go spinning in a random direction. When moving in null gravity you maintain momentum until you run into a solid object. In a large space you may use one turn to move your movement speed. You will continue to move your movement speed every subsequent turn until you run into something, or are able to propel yourself somehow. Grav Boots and Jet Packs are very useful in Null G.

#### Creature Size

Each creature takes up a different amount of space. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. Objects sometimes use the same size categories.

**Size Categories (table)**

| Size       | Space                  |
|------------|------------------------|
| Tiny       | 2½ by 2½ ft.           |
| Small      | 5 by 5 ft.             |
| Medium     | 5 by 5 ft.             |
| Large      | 10 by 10 ft.           |
| Huge       | 15 by 15 ft.           |
| Gargantuan | 20 by 20 ft. or larger |

##### Space

A creature’s space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium creature isn’t 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5* foot-wide doorway, other creatures can’t get through unless the hobgoblin lets them.

A creature’s space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there’s a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one.

Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If five Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there’s little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.

##### Squeezing into a Smaller Space

A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that’s only 5 feet wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it’s in the smaller space.

### Actions in Combat

When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your class or a special feature, or an action that you improvise. Many monsters have action options of their own in their stat blocks.

When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the GM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.

#### Attack

The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an bullet from a bow, or brawling with your fists.

With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the “Making an Attack” section for the rules that govern attacks.

Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the fighter, allow you to make more than one attack with this action.

#### Cast a Tek

Tekcasters such as wizards and clerics, as well as many monsters, have access to tek skills and can use them to great effect in combat. Each tek skill has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the tek skill. Casting a tek skill is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most tek skills do have a casting time of 1 action, so a tekcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a tek skill.

#### Dash

When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you dash.

Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you dash.

#### Disengage

If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.

#### Dodge

When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated (as explained in appendix A) or if your speed drops to 0.

#### Help

You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn.

Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally’s attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage.

#### Hide

When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the “Unseen Attackers and Targets” section later in this chapter.

#### Ready

Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn.

First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include “If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I’ll pull the lever that opens it,” and “If the goblin steps next to me, I move away.”

When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.

When you ready a tek skill, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a tek skill must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the tek skill’s tek requires concentration. If your concentration is broken, the tek skill dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the _web_ tek skill and ready _tek missile_, your _web_ tek skill ends, and if you take damage before you release _tek missile_ with your reaction, your concentration might be broken.

#### Search

When you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search, the GM might have you make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check.

#### Use an Object

You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When an object requires your action for its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn.

### Making an Attack

Whether you’re striking with a melee weapon, firing a weapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a tek skill, an attack has a simple structure.

1. **Choose a target.** Pick a target within your attack’s range: a creature, an object, or a location.
2. **Determine modifiers.** The GM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage against the target. In addition, tek skills, special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.
3. **Resolve the attack.** You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead of damage.

If there’s ever any question whether something you’re doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you’re making an attack roll, you’re making an attack.

#### Attack Rolls

When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target’s Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. The AC of a character is determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a monster is in its stat block.

##### Modifiers to the Roll

When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character’s proficiency bonus. When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat block.

**_Ability Modifier_** The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that have the finesse or thrown property break this rule.

Some tek skills also require an attack roll. The ability modifier used for a tek skill attack depends on the Tekcasting ability of the tekcaster.

**_Proficiency Bonus_** You add your proficiency bonus to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with which you have proficiency, as well as when you attack with a tek skill.

##### Rolling 1 or 20

Sometimes fate blesses or hacks a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.

If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC. This is called a critical hit, which is explained later in this chapter.

If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC.

#### Unseen Attackers and Targets

Combatants often try to escape their foes’ notice by hiding, casting the invisibility tek skill, or lurking in darkness.

When you attack a target that you can’t see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether you’re guessing the target’s location or you’re targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn’t in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the GM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the target’s location correctly.

When a creature can’t see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it. If you are hidden—both unseen and unheard—when you make an attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.

#### Ranged Attacks

When you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a crossbow, hurl a handaxe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe at a distance. A monster might shoot spines from its tail. Many tek skills also involve making a ranged attack.

##### Range

You can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range.

If a ranged attack, such as one made with a tek skill, has a single range, you can’t attack a target beyond this range.

Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a railrifle or a scorcher, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your target is beyond normal range, and you can’t attack a target beyond the long range.

##### Ranged Attacks in Close Combat

Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a tek skill, or some other means, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see you and who isn’t incapacitated.

#### Melee Attacks

Used in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon such as a sword, an ion slingblade, or an axe. A typical monster makes a melee attack when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other body part. A few tek skills also involve making a melee attack.

Most creatures have a 5-foot **reach** and can thus attack targets within 5 feet of them when making a melee attack. Certain creatures (typically those larger than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.

Instead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use an **unarmed strike**: a punch, kick, head-butt, or similar forceful blow (none of which count as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + your Strength modifier. You are proficient with your unarmed strikes.

##### Opportunity Attacks

In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance to strike an enemy who is fleeing or passing by. Such a strike is called an opportunity attack.

You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach.

You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the Disengage action. You also don’t provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport or when someone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction. For example, you don’t provoke an opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe’s reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.

##### Two-Weapon Fighting

When you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon that you’re holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different light melee weapon that you’re holding in the other hand. You don’t add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.

If either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it.

##### Grappling

When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.

The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check instead of an attack roll: a Strength (Physique) check contested by the target’s Strength (Physique) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled condition (see appendix A). The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).

**_Escaping a Grapple_** A grappled creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Physique) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your Strength
(Physique) check.

**_Moving a Grappled Creature_** When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.

> #### Contests in Combat
>
> Battle often involves pitting your prowess against that of your foe. Such a challenge is represented by a contest. This section includes the most common contests that require an action in combat: grappling and shoving a creature. The GM can use these contests as models for improvising others.

##### Shoving a Creature

Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or push it away from you. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.

The target must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Instead of making an attack roll, you make a Strength (Physique) check contested by the target’s Strength (Physique) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you win the contest, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from you.

### Cover

Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.

There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren’t added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.

A target with **half cover** has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a nbullet tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.

A target with **three-quarters cover** has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an bullet slit, or a thick tree trunk.

A target with **total cover** can’t be targeted directly by an attack or a tek skill, although some tek skills can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.

### Damage and Healing

Injury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who explore futuristic gaming worlds. The thrust of a sword, a well-placed bullet, or a blast of flame from a *fireball* tek skill all have the potential to damage, or even kill, the hardiest of creatures.

#### Hit Points

Hit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more fragile.

A creature’s current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be any number from the creature’s hit point maximum down to 0. This number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing.

Whenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature’s capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points.

#### Damage Rolls

Each weapon, tek skill, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to your target. Tek weapons, special abilities, and other factors can grant a bonus to damage. With a penalty, it is possible to deal 0 damage, but never negative damage.

When attacking with a **weapon**, you add your ability modifier—the same modifier used for the attack roll—to the damage. A **tek skill** tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers.

If a tek skill or other effect deals damage to **more than one target** at the same time, roll the damage once for all of them. For example, when a wizard casts _fireball_ or a cleric casts _flame strike_, the tek skill’s damage is rolled once for all creatures caught in the blast.

##### Critical Hits

When you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the attack’s damage against the target. Roll all of the attack’s damage dice twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, you can roll all the damage dice at once.

For example, if you score a critical hit with an ion dagger, roll 2d4 for the damage, rather than 1d4, and then add your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the rogue’s Stealth Attack feature, you roll those dice twice as well.

##### Damage Types

Different attacks, damaging tek skills, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.

The damage types follow, with examples to help a GM assign a damage type to a new effect.

**_Acid_** The corrosive spray of a black dragon’s breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage.

**_Bludgeoning_** Blunt force attacks—hammers, falling, constriction, and the like—deal bludgeoning damage.

**_Cold_** The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil’s spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon’s breath deal cold damage.

**_Fire_** Red dragons breathe fire, and many tek skills conjure flames to deal fire damage.

**_Force_** Force is pure tek energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are tek skills, including _tek missile_ and _spiritual weapon_.

**_Shock_** A _lightning bolt_ tek skill and a blue dragon’s breath deal lightning damage.

**_Radiation_** Radiation damage, dealt by certain undead and a tek skill such as _chill touch_, withers matter and even the soul.

**_Piercing_** Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and monsters’ bites, deal piercing damage.

**_Poison_** Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green dragon’s breath deal poison damage.

**_Psychic_** Mental abilities such as a mind flayer’s psionic blast deal psychic damage.

**_Radiant_** Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric’s _flame strike_ tek skill or an angel’s smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.

**_Slashing_** Swords, axes, and monsters’ claws deal slashing damage.

**_Concussive_** A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the _shockwave_ tek skill, deals concussive damage.

#### Damage Resistance and Vulnerability

Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.

If a creature or an object has **resistance** to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has **vulnerability** to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.

Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a tek aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.

Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all nontek damage, the damage of a nontek fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three* quarters.

#### Healing

Unless it results in death, damage isn’t permanent. Even death is reversible through powerful tek. Rest can restore a creature’s hit points, and tek methods such as a _cure wounds_ tek skill or a _potion of healing_ can remove damage in an instant.

When a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature’s hit points can’t exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points from the druid, not 8.

A creature that has died can’t regain hit points until tek such as the _revivify_ tek skill has restored it to life.

#### Dropping to 0 Hit Points

When you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections.

##### Instant Death

Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.

For example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric dies.

##### Falling Unconscious

If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall unconscious (see appendix A). This unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.

##### Death Saving Throws

Whenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn’t tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by tek skills and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw.

Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable.

**_Rolling 1 or 20_** When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.

**_Damage at 0 Hit Points_** If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.

##### Stabilizing a Creature

The best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that it isn’t killed by a failed death saving throw.

You can use your action to administer first aid to an unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.

A **stable** creature doesn’t make death saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious. The creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn’t healed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.

##### Monsters and Death

Most GMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it fall unconscious and make death saving throws.

Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the GM might have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as player characters.

#### Knocking a Creature Out

Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls unconscious and is stable.

#### Temporary Hit Points

Some tek skills and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a creature. Temporary hit points aren’t actual hit points; they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from injury.

When you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage.

Because temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character can, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.

Healing can’t restore temporary hit points, and they can’t be added together. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a tek skill grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.

If you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn’t restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. They can still absorb damage directed at you while you’re in that state, but only true healing can save you.

Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, they last until they’re depleted or you finish a long rest.

### Mounted Combat

A knight charging into battle on a warhorse, a wizard casting tek skills from the back of a griffon, or a cleric soaring through the sky on a pegasus all enjoy the benefits of speed and mobility that a mount can provide.

A willing creature that is at least one size larger than you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount, using the following rules.

#### Mounting and Dismounting

Once during your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to mount a horse. Therefore, you can’t mount it if you don’t have 15 feet of movement left or if your speed is 0.

If an effect moves your mount against its will while you’re on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off the mount, landing prone in a space within 5 feet of it. If you’re knocked prone while mounted, you must make the same saving throw.

If your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall prone in a space within 5 feet it.

#### Controlling a Mount

You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assumed to have such training. The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has only three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it.

An independent mount retains its place in the initiative order. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the actions the mount can take, and it moves and acts as it wishes. It might flee from combat, rush to attack and devour a badly injured foe, or otherwise act against your wishes.

In either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity attack while you’re on it, the attacker can target you or the mount.

### Mechanical Mounts
Mechanical mounts move on your turn, and some have certain restrictions for what actions you can take.

### Underwater Combat

When adventurers pursue sahuagin back to their undersea homes, fight off sharks in an ancient shipwreck, or find themselves in a flooded dungeon room, they must fight in a challenging environment. Underwater the following rules apply.

When making a **melee weapon attack**, a creature that doesn’t have a swimming speed (either natural or granted by tek) has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon is an ion dagger, javelin, ion blade, spear, or trident.

A **ranged weapon attack** automatically misses a target beyond the weapon’s normal range. Even against a target within normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear, trident, or dart).

Creatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have resistance to fire damage.

<!-- Conditions -->
\page
## Conditions

---

Conditions alter a creature’s capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a tek skill, a class feature, a monster’s attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous.

A condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.

If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition’s effects don’t get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn’t.

The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a condition.

### Blinded
* A blinded creature can’t see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.
* Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage.

### Charmed
* A charmed creature can’t attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or tek effects.
* The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.

### Deafened
* A deafened creature can’t hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing.

### Exhaustion

Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect’s description.

| Level | Effect                                         |
|-------|------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Disadvantage on ability checks                 |
| 2     | Speed halved                                   |
| 3     | Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws |
| 4     | Hit point maximum halved                       |
| 5     | Speed reduced to 0                             |
| 6     | Death                                          |

If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect’s description.

A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.

An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect’s description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature’s exhaustion level is reduced below 1.

Finishing a long rest reduces a creature’s exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.

### Frightened
* A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.
* The creature can’t willingly move closer to the source of its fear.

### Grappled
* A grappled creature’s speed becomes 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed.
* The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated (see the condition).
* The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the *concussive-wave* tek skill.

### Incapacitated
* An incapacitated creature can’t take actions or reactions.

### Invisible
* An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of tek or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature’s location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.
* Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have advantage.

### Paralyzed
* A paralyzed creature is incapacitated (see the condition) and can’t move or speak.
* The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
* Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
* Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.

### Petrified
* A petrified creature is transformed, along with any nontek object it is wearing or carrying, into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone). Its weight increases by a factor of ten, and it ceases aging.
* The creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can’t move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.
* Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
* The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
* The creature has resistance to all damage.
* The creature is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized.

### Poisoned
* A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

### Prone
* A prone creature’s only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.
* The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.
* An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.

### Restrained
* A restrained creature’s speed becomes 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed.
* Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage.
* The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.

### Stunned
* A stunned creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can’t move, and can speak only falteringly.
* The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
* Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.

### Unconscious
* An unconscious creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can’t move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings
* The creature drops whatever it’s holding and falls prone.
* The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
* Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
* Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.

## Tekcasting

---

This chapter provides the rules for casting tek skills. Different character classes have distinctive ways of learning and preparing their tek skills, and monsters use tek skills in unique ways. Regardless of its source, a tek skill follows the rules here.

### What Is Tek?

Centuries ago a derelict alien space station was discovered in the belt. All its inhabitants had long since disappeared, but much of the alien technology was uncovered.
These mysterious devices became known as tekcasters. Specialized engineers known as Artificers learned how to use these devices, and reverse engineered them to create all sorts of tek items. Although the inner workings of tek led to a technological revolution for every field of science. The two largest impacts were the invention of Stacks, and the advancement of genetics. The latter led to the creation of hundreds of species of fantastic creatures brought to life and populated the wilds of the newly terraformed worlds.

#### Tek Level

Every tek skill has a level from 0 to 9. A tek skill’s level is a general indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly (but still impressive) _tek missile_ at 1st level and the earth-shaking _power word kill_ at 9th. Cantrips—simple but powerful tek skills that characters can cast almost by rote—are level 0. The higher a tek skill’s level, the higher level a tekcaster must be to use that tek skill.

Tek level and character level don’t correspond directly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17th level, not 9th level, to cast a 9th-level tek skill.

#### Known and Prepared Tek Skills

Before a tekcaster can use a tek skill, he or she must have the tek skill firmly fixed in mind, or must have access to the tek skill in a alien artifact. Members of a few classes, including bards and sorcerers, have a limited list of tek skills they know that are always fixed in mind. The same thing is true of many tek-using monsters. Other tekcasters, such as clerics and wizards, undergo a process of preparing tek skills. This process varies for different classes, as detailed in their descriptions.

In every case, the number of tek skills a caster can have fixed in mind at any given time depends on the character’s level.

#### Tek Slots

Regardless of how many tek skills a caster knows or prepares, he or she can cast only a limited number of tek skills before resting. Manipulating the fabric of tek and channeling its energy into even a simple tek skill is physically and mentally taxing, and higher level tek skills are even more so. Thus, each Tekcasting class’s description (except that of the warlock) includes a table showing how many tek skill slots of each tek skill level a character can use at each character level. For example, the 3rd-level wizard Umara has four 1st-level tek skill slots and two 2nd-level slots.

When a character casts a tek skill, he or she expends a slot of that tek skill’s level or higher, effectively “filling” a slot with the tek skill. You can think of a tek skill slot as a groove of a certain size—small for a 1st-level slot, larger for a tek skill of higher level. A 1st-level tek skill fits into a slot of any size, but a 9th-level tek skill fits only in a 9th-level slot. So when Umara casts _tek missile_, a 1st-level tek skill, she spends one of her four 1st-level slots and has three remaining.

Finishing a long rest restores any expended tek skill slots.

Some characters and monsters have special abilities that let them cast tek skills without using tek skill slots. For example, a monk who follows the Way of the Four Elements, a warlock who chooses certain eldritch invocations, and a pit fiend from the Nine Hells can all cast tek skills in such a way.

##### Casting a Tek Skill at a Higher Level

When a tekcaster casts a tek skill using a slot that is of a higher level than the tek skill, the tek skill assumes the higher level for that casting. For instance, if Umara casts _tek missile_ using one of her 2nd-level slots, that _tek missile_ is 2nd level. Effectively, the tek skill expands to fill the slot it is put into.

Some tek skills, such as _tek missile_ and _cure wounds_, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a tek skill’s description.

> #### Casting in Armor
>
>Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required for Tekcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you are wearing to cast a tek skill. You are otherwise too distracted and physically hampered by your armor for Tekcasting.

#### Cantrips

A cantrip is a tek skill that can be cast at will, without using a tek skill slot and without being prepared in advance. Repeated practice has fixed the tek skill in the caster’s mind and infused the caster with the tek needed to produce the effect over and over. A cantrip’s tek skill level is 0.

#### Rituals

Certain tek skills have a special tag: ritual. Such a tek skill can be cast following the normal rules for Tekcasting, or the tek skill can be cast as a ritual. The ritual version of a tek skill takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal. It also doesn’t expend a tek skill slot, which means the ritual version of a tek skill can’t be cast at a higher level.

To cast a tek skill as a ritual, a tekcaster must have a feature that grants the ability to do so. The cleric and the druid, for example, have such a feature. The caster must also have the tek skill prepared or on his or her list of tek skills known, unless the character’s ritual feature specifies otherwise, as the wizard’s does.

### Casting a Tek Skill

When a character casts any tek skill, the same basic rules are followed, regardless of the character’s class or the tek skill’s effects.

Each tek skill description begins with a block of information, including the tek skill’s name, level, school of tek, casting time, range, components, and duration. The rest of a tek skill entry describes the tek skill’s effect.

#### Casting Time

Most tek skills require a single action to cast, but some tek skills require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more time to cast.

##### Bonus Action

A tek skill cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the tek skill, provided that you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn. You can’t cast another tek skill during the same turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.

##### Reactions

Some tek skills can be cast as reactions. These tek skills take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response to some event. If a tek skill can be cast as a reaction, the tek skill description tells you exactly when you can do so.

##### Longer Casting Times

Certain tek skills (including tek skills cast as rituals) require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a tek skill with a casting time longer than a single action or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting the tek skill, and you must maintain your concentration while you do so (see “Concentration” below). If your concentration is broken, the tek skill fails, but you don’t expend a tek skill slot. If you want to try casting the tek skill again, you must start over.

#### Tek Range

The target of a tek skill must be within the tek skill’s range. For a tek skill like _tek missile_, the target is a creature. For a tek skill like _fireball_, the target is the point in space where the ball of fire erupts.

Most tek skills have ranges expressed in feet. Some tek skills can target only a creature (including you) that you touch. Other tek skills, such as the _shield_ tek skill, affect only you. These tek skills have a range of self.

Tek Skills that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also have a range of self, indicating that the origin point of the tek skill’s effect must be you (see “Areas of Effect” later in the this chapter).

Once a tek skill is cast, its effects aren’t limited by its range, unless the tek skill’s description says otherwise.

#### Components

A tek skill’s components are the physical requirements you must meet in order to cast it. Each tek skill’s description indicates whether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components. If you can’t provide one or more of a tek skill’s components, you are unable to cast the tek skill.

##### Verbal (V)

Most tek skills require the chanting of mystic words. The words themselves aren’t the source of the tek skill’s power; rather, the particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of tek in motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area of silence, such as one created by the _silence_ tek skill, can’t cast a tek skill with a verbal component.

##### Somatic (S)

Tekcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a tek skill requires a somatic component, the caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures.

##### Material (M)

Some tek skills require a Material component. This is almost always in the form of a gemstone which is sometimes destroyed. The gemstone is set into a slot of the tekcaster. You can have up to 5 gemstones loaded into the tekcaster at a time. 

#### Duration

A tek skill’s duration is the length of time the tek skill persists. A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years. Some tek skills specify that their effects last until the tek skills are ditek skilled or destroyed.

##### Instantaneous

Many tek skills are instantaneous. The tek skill harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can’t be ditek skilled, because its tek exists only for an instant.

##### Concentration

Some tek skills require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their tek active. If you lose concentration, such a tek skill ends.

If a tek skill must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the tek skill specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).

Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn’t interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:

* **Casting another tek skill that requires concentration.** You lose concentration on a tek skill if you cast another tek skill that requires concentration. You can’t concentrate on two tek skills at once.
* **Taking damage.** Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a tek skill, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, such as an bullet and a dragon’s breath, you make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.
* **Being incapacitated or killed.** You lose concentration on a tek skill if you are incapacitated or if you die.

The GM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you’re on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a tek skill.

#### Targets

A typical tek skill requires you to pick one or more targets to be affected by the tek skill’s tek. A tek skill’s description tells you whether the tek skill targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect (described below).

Unless a tek skill has a perceptible effect, a creature might not know it was targeted by a tek skill at all. An effect like crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read a creature’s thoughts, typically goes unnoticed, unless a tek skill says otherwise.

##### A Clear Path to the Target

To target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can’t be behind total cover.

If you place an area of effect at a point that you can’t see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of that obstruction.

##### Targeting Yourself

If a tek skill targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically a creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect of a tek skill you cast, you can target yourself.

#### Areas of Effect

Tek Skills such as _burning hands_ and _cone of cold_ cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.

A tek skill’s description specifies its area of effect, which typically has one of five different shapes: cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a **point of origin**, a location from which the tek skill’s energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify how you position its point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in space, but some tek skills have an area whose origin is a creature or an object.

A tek skill’s effect expands in straight lines from the point of origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from the point of origin to a location within the area of effect, that location isn’t included in the tek skill’s area. To block one of these imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide total cover.

##### Cone

A cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. A cone’s width at a given point along its length is equal to that point’s distance from the point of origin. A cone’s area of effect specifies its maximum length.

A cone’s point of origin is not included in the cone’s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.

##### Cube

You select a cube’s point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of the cubic effect. The cube’s size is expressed as the length of each side.

A cube’s point of origin is not included in the cube’s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.

##### Cylinder

A cylinder’s point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular radius, as given in the tek skill description. The circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the tek skill effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in straight lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The tek skill’s effect then shoots up from the base or down from the top, to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder.

A cylinder’s point of origin is included in the cylinder’s area of effect.

##### Line

A line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its length and covers an area defined by its width.

A line’s point of origin is not included in the line’s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.

##### Sphere

You select a sphere’s point of origin, and the sphere extends outward from that point. The sphere’s size is expressed as a radius in feet that extends from the point.

A sphere’s point of origin is included in the sphere’s area of effect.

#### Tek Saving Throws

Many tek skills specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid some or all of a tek skill’s effects. The tek skill specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure.

The DC to resist one of your tek skills equals 8 + your Tekcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus + any special modifiers.

#### Tek Attack Rolls

Some tek skills require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the tek skill effect hits the intended target. Your attack bonus with a tek skill attack equals your Tekcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus.

Most tek skills that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks. Remember that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature that can see you and that isn’t incapacitated.

> #### The Schools of Tek
>
> Academies of tek group tek skills into eight categories called schools of tek. Scholars, particularly wizards, apply these categories to all tek skills, believing that all tek functions in essentially the same way, whether it derives from rigorous study or is bestowed by a deity.
>
> The schools of tek help describe tek skills; they have no rules of their own, although some rules refer to the schools.
>
> **Abjuration** tek skills are protective in nature, though some of them have aggressive uses. They create tek barriers, negate harmful effects, harm trespassers, or banish creatures to other planes of existence.
>
> **Conjuration** tek skills involve the transportation of objects and creatures from one location to another. Some tek skills summon creatures or objects to the caster’s side, whereas others allow the caster to teleport to another location. Some conjurations create objects or effects out of nothing.
>
> **Divination** tek skills reveal information, whether in the form of secrets long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the locations of hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or visions of distant people or places.
>
> **Enchantment** tek skills affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behavior. Such tek skills can make enemies see the caster as a friend, force creatures to take a course of action, or even control another creature like a puppet.
>
> **Evocation** tek skills manipulate tek energy to produce a desired effect. Some call up blasts of fire or lightning. Others channel positive energy to heal wounds.
>
> **Illusion** tek skills deceive the senses or minds of others. They cause people to see things that are not there, to miss things that are there, to hear phantom noises, or to remember things that never happened. Some illusions create phantom images that any creature can see, but the most insidious illusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature.
>
> **Necromancy** tek skills manipulate the energies of life and death. Such tek skills can grant an extra reserve of life force, drain the life energy from another creature, create the undead, or even bring the dead back to life.
>
> Creating the undead through the use of necromancy tek skills such as _animate dead_ is not a good act, and only evil casters use such tek skills frequently.
>
> **Transmutation** tek skills change the properties of a creature, object, or environment. They might turn an enemy into a harmless creature, bolster the strength of an ally, make an object move at the caster’s command, or enhance a creature’s innate healing abilities to rapidly recover from injury.

#### Combining Tek Effects

The effects of different tek skills add together while the durations of those tek skills overlap. The effects of the same tek skill cast multiple times don’t combine, however. Instead, the most potent effect—such as the highest bonus—from those castings applies while their durations overlap.

For example, if two clerics cast _bless_ on the same target, that character gains the tek skill’s benefit only once; he or she doesn’t get to roll two bonus dice.

**Tek Descriptions**

### Tek Skills (A)

##### Acid Bullet

_2nd-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 90 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A shimmering green bullet streaks toward a target within range and bursts in a spray of acid. Make a ranged tek skill attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d4 acid damage immediately and 2d4 acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the bullet splashes the target with acid for half as much of the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage (both initial and later) increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 2nd.

##### Acid Splash

_Conjuration cantrip_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You hurl a bubble of acid. Choose one creature within range, or choose two creatures within range that are within 5 feet of each other. A target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 acid damage.

This tek skill’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

##### Aid

_2nd-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 8 hours

Your tek skill bolsters your allies with toughness and resolve. Choose up to three creatures within range. Each target’s hit point maximum and current hit points increase by 5 for the duration.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 3rd level or higher, a target’s hit points increase by an additional 5 for each slot level above 2nd.

##### Alarm

_1st-level abjuration (ritual)_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 8 hours

You set an alarm against unwanted intrusion. Choose a door, a window, or an area within range that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. Until the tek skill ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a Tiny or larger creature touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the tek skill, you can designate creatures that won’t set off the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm is mental or audible.

A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping.

An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds within 60 feet.

##### Alter Self

_2nd-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You assume a different form. When you cast the tek skill, choose one of the following options, the effects of which last for the duration of the tek skill. While the tek skill lasts, you can end one option as an action to gain the benefits of a different one.

**_Aquatic Adaptation._** You adapt your body to an aquatic environment, sprouting gills and growing webbing between your fingers. You can breathe underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

**_Change Appearance._** You transform your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your statistics change. You also can’t appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if you’re bipedal, you can’t use this tek skill to become quadrupedal, for instance. At any time for the duration of the tek skill, you can use your action to change your appearance in this way again.

**_Natural Weapons._** You grow claws, fangs, spines, horns, or a different natural weapon of your choice. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, as appropriate to the natural weapon you chose, and you are proficient with your unarmed strikes. Finally, the natural weapon is tek and you have a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls you make using it.

##### Animal Messenger

_2nd-level enchantment (ritual)_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 24 hours

By means of this tek skill, you use an animal to deliver a message. Choose a Tiny beast you can see within range, such as a squirrel, a blue jay, or a bat. You specify a location, which you must have visited, and a recipient who matches a general description, such as “a man or woman dressed in the uniform of the town guard” or “a red-haired dwarf wearing a pointed hat.” You also speak a message of up to twenty-five words. The target beast travels for the duration of the tek skill toward the specified location, covering about 50 miles per 24 hours for a flying messenger, or 25 miles for other animals.

When the messenger arrives, it delivers your message to the creature that you described, replicating the sound of your voice. The messenger speaks only to a creature matching the description you gave. If the messenger doesn’t reach its destination before the tek skill ends, the message is lost, and the beast makes its way back to where you cast this tek skill.

**_At Higher Levels._** If you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 3nd level or higher, the duration of the tek skill increases by 48 hours for each slot level above 2nd.

##### Animal Shapes

_8th-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 24 hours

Your tek turns others into beasts. Choose any number of willing creatures that you can see within range. You transform each target into the form of a Large or smaller beast with a challenge rating of 4 or lower. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to transform affected creatures into new forms.

The transformation lasts for the duration for each target, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. You can choose a different form for each target. A target’s game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast, though the target retains its alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, it returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn’t knocked unconscious. The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak or cast tek skills.

The target’s gear melds into the new form. The target can’t activate, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

##### Animate Dead

_3rd-level necromancy_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** 10 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

This tek skill creates an undead servant. Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a Medium or Small humanoid within range. Your tek skill imbues the target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an undead creature. The target becomes a skeleton if you chose bones or a zombie if you chose a corpse (the GM has the creature’s game statistics).

On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any creature you made with this tek skill if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.

The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you’ve given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this tek skill on the creature again before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the tek skill reasserts your control over up to four creatures you have animated with this tek skill, rather than animating a new one.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 4th level or higher, you animate or reassert control over two additional undead creatures for each slot level above 3rd. Each of the creatures must come from a different corpse or pile of bones.

##### Animate Objects

_5th-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Objects come to life at your command. Choose up to ten nontek objects within range that are not being worn or carried. Medium targets count as two objects, Large targets count as four objects, Huge targets count as eight objects. You can’t animate any object larger than Huge. Each target animates and becomes a creature under your control until the tek skill ends or until reduced to 0 hit points.

As a bonus action, you can mentally command any creature you made with this tek skill if the creature is within 500 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.

**Animated Object Statistics (table)**

| Size   | HP | AC | Attack                     | Str | Dex |
|--------|----|----|----------------------------|-----|-----|
| Tiny   | 20 | 18 | +8 to hit, 1d4 + 4 damage  | 4   | 18  |
| Small  | 25 | 16 | +6 to hit, 1d8 + 2 damage  | 6   | 14  |
| Medium | 40 | 13 | +5 to hit, 2d6 + 1 damage  | 10  | 12  |
| Large  | 50 | 10 | +6 to hit, 2d10 + 2 damage | 14  | 10  |
| Huge   | 80 | 10 | +8 to hit, 2d12 + 4 damage | 18  | 6   |

An animated object is a construct with AC, hit points, attacks, Strength, and Dexterity determined by its size. Its Constitution is 10 and its Intelligence and Wisdom are 3, and its Charisma is 1. Its speed is

30 feet; if the object lacks legs or other appendages it can use for locomotion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover. If the object is securely attached to a surface or a larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its speed is 0. It has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and is blind beyond that distance. When the animated object drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original object form, and any remaining damage carries over to its original object form.

If you command an object to attack, it can make a single melee attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. It makes a slam attack with an attack bonus and bludgeoning damage determined by its size. The GM might rule that a specific object inflicts slashing or piercing damage based on its form.

**_At Higher Levels._** If you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 6th level or higher, you can animate two additional objects for each slot level above 5th.

##### Antilife Shell

_5th-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self (10-foot radius)

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

A shimmering barrier extends out from you in a 10* foot radius and moves with you, remaining centered on you and hedging out creatures other than undead and constructs. The barrier lasts for the duration.

The barrier prevents an affected creature from passing or reaching through. An affected creature can cast tek skills or make attacks with ranged or reach weapons through the barrier.

If you move so that an affected creature is forced to pass through the barrier, the tek skill ends.

##### Antitek Field

_8th-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self (10-foot-radius sphere)

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

A 10-foot-radius invisible sphere of antitek surrounds you. This area is divorced from the tek energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, tek skills can’t be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even alien artifacts become mundane. Until the tek skill ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.

Tek Skills and other tek effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can’t protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed tek skill is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn’t function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.

**_Targeted Effects._** Tek Skills and other tek effects, such as _tek missile_ and _charm person_, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.

**_Areas of Tek._** The area of another tek skill or tek effect, such as _fireball_, can’t extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of tek, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a _wall of fire_ are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.

**_Tek Skills._** Any active tek skill or other tek effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.

**_Alien Artifacts._** The properties and powers of alien artifacts are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a _+1 pulse blade_ in the sphere functions as a nontek pulse blade.

A tek weapon’s properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a tek weapon or a piece of tek ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a tek bullet or throw a tek spear at a target outside the sphere), the tek of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.

**_Tek Travel._** Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such tek travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the _rope trick_ tek skill, temporarily closes while in the sphere.

**_Creatures and Objects._** A creature or object summoned or created by tek temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.

**_Dispel Tek._** Tek Skills and tek effects such as _dispel tek_ have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different _antitek field_ tek skills don’t nullify each other.

##### Antipathy/Sympathy

_8th-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** 1 hour

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 10 days

This tek skill attracts or repels creatures of your choice. You target something within range, either a Huge or smaller object or creature or an area that is no larger than a 200-foot cube. Then specify a kind of intelligent creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires. You invest the target with an aura that either attracts or repels the specified creatures for the duration. Choose antipathy or sympathy as the aura’s effect.

**_Antipathy._** The enchantment causes creatures of the kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the area and avoid the target. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened. The creature remains frightened while it can see the target or is within 60 feet of it. While frightened by the target, the creature must use its movement to move to the nearest safe spot from which it can’t see the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the target and can’t see it, the creature is no longer frightened, but the creature becomes frightened again if it regains sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of it.

**_Sympathy._** The enchantment causes the specified creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target while within 60 feet of it or able to see it. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or use its movement on each of its turns to enter the area or move within reach of the target. When the creature has done so, it can’t willingly move away from the target.

If the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the affected creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as described below.

**_Ending the Effect._** If an affected creature ends its turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see it, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or attraction as tek. In addition, a creature affected by the tek skill is allowed another Wisdom saving throw every 24 hours while the tek skill persists.

A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be affected again.

##### Arcane Eye

_4th-level divination_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You create an invisible, tek eye within range that hovers in the air for the duration.

You mentally receive visual information from the eye, which has normal vision and darkvision out to 30 feet. The eye can look in every direction.

As an action, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in any direction. There is no limit to how far away from you the eye can move, but it can’t enter another plane of existence. A solid barrier blocks the eye’s movement, but the eye can pass through an opening as small as 1 inch in diameter.

##### Arcane Hand

_5th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a Large hand of shimmering, translucent force in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The hand lasts for the tek skill’s duration, and it moves at your command, mimicking the movements of your own hand.

The hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your hit point maximum. If it drops to 0 hit points, the tek skill ends. It has a Strength of 26 (+8) and a Dexterity of 10 (+0). The hand doesn’t fill its space.

When you cast the tek skill and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following effects with it.

**_Clenched Fist._** The hand strikes one creature or object within 5 feet of it. Make a melee tek skill attack for the hand using your game statistics. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 force damage.

**_Forceful Hand._** The hand attempts to push a creature within 5 feet of it in a direction you choose.

Make a check with the hand’s Strength contested by the Strength (Physique) check of the target. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your Tekcasting ability modifier. The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it.

**_Grasping Hand._** The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand’s Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. While the hand is grappling the target, you can use a bonus action to have the hand crush it. When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your Tekcasting ability modifier.

**_Interposing Hand._** The hand interposes itself between you and a creature you choose until you give the hand a different command. The hand moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with half cover against the target. The target can’t move through the hand’s space if its Strength score is less than or equal to the hand’s Strength score. If its Strength score is higher than the hand’s Strength score, the target can move toward you through the hand’s space, but that space is difficult terrain for the target.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 6th level or higher, the damage from the clenched fist option increases by 2d8 and the damage from the grasping hand increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 5th.

##### Arcane Lock

_2nd-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (gem worth at least 2,500 credits, which the tek skill consumes)

**Duration:** Until ditek skilled

You touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other entryway, and it becomes locked for the duration. You and the creatures you designate when you cast this tek skill can open the object normally. You can also set a password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, suppresses this tek skill for 1 minute. Otherwise, it is impassable until it is broken or the tek skill is ditek skilled or suppressed. Casting _knock_ on the object suppresses _arcane lock_ for 10 minutes.

While affected by this tek skill, the object is more difficult to break or force open; the DC to break it or pick any locks on it increases by 10.

##### Arcane Sword

_7th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem worth 25,000 credits)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a sword-shaped plane of force that hovers within range. It lasts for the duration.

When the sword appears, you make a melee tek skill attack against a target of your choice within 5 feet of the sword. On a hit, the target takes 3d10 force damage. Until the tek skill ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to move the sword up to 20 feet to a spot you can see and repeat this attack against the same target or a different one.

##### Arcanist’s Tek Aura

_2nd-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 24 hours

You place an illusion on a creature or an object you touch so that divination tek skills reveal false information about it. The target can be a willing creature or an object that isn’t being carried or worn by another creature.

When you cast the tek skill, choose one or both of the following effects. The effect lasts for the duration. If you cast this tek skill on the same creature or object every day for 30 days, placing the same effect on it each time, the illusion lasts until it is ditek skilled.

**_False Aura._** You change the way the target appears to tek skills and tek effects, such as _detect tek_, that detect tek auras. You can make a nontek object appear tek, a tek object appear nontek, or change the object’s tek aura so that it appears to belong to a specific school of tek that you choose. When you use this effect on an object, you can make the false tek apparent to any creature that handles the item.

**_Mask._** You change the way the target appears to tek skills and tek effects that detect creature types, such as a paladin’s Divine Sense or the trigger of a _symbol_ tek skill. You choose a creature type and other tek skills and tek effects treat the target as if it were a creature of that type or of that alignment.

##### Astral Projection

_9th-level necromancy_

**Casting Time:** 1 hour

**Range:** 10 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem worth 10000 credits)

**Duration:** Special

You and up to eight willing creatures within range project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the tek skill fails and the casting is wasted if you are already on that plane). The material body you leave behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended animation; it doesn’t need food or air and doesn’t age.

Your astral body resembles your mortal form in almost every way, replicating your game statistics and possessions. The principal difference is the addition of a silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after 1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material body. As long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way home. If the cord is cut—something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it does—your soul and body are separated, killing you instantly.

Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any other plane. If you enter a new plane or return to the plane you were on when casting this tek skill, your body and possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane. Your astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage or other effects that apply to it have no effect on your physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it.

The tek skill ends for you and your companions when you use your action to dismiss it. When the tek skill ends, the affected creature returns to its physical body, and it awakens.

The tek skill might also end early for you or one of your companions. A successful _dispel tek_ tek skill used against an astral or physical body ends the tek skill for that creature. If a creature’s original body or its astral form drops to 0 hit points, the tek skill ends for that creature. If the tek skill ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls the creature’s astral form back to its body, ending its state of suspended animation.

If you are returned to your body prematurely, your companions remain in their astral forms and must find their own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping to 0 hit points.

##### Augury

_2nd-level divination (ritual)_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem worth at least 2500 credits)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The GM chooses from the following possible omens:

* _Weal_, for good results
* _Woe_, for bad results
* _Weal and woe_, for both good and bad results
* _Nothing_, for results that aren’t especially good or bad

The tek skill doesn’t take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional tek skills or the loss or gain of a companion.

If you cast the tek skill two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The GM makes this roll in secret.

##### Awaken

_5th-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 8 hours

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem worth 100,000 credits, which the tek skill consumes)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

After spending the casting time tracing tek pathways within a precious gemstone, you touch a Huge or smaller beast or plant. The target must have either no Intelligence score or an Intelligence of 3 or less. The target gains an Intelligence of 10. The target also gains the ability to speak one language you know. If the target is a plant, it gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it gains senses similar to a human’s. Your GM chooses statistics appropriate for the awakened plant, such as the statistics for the awakened shrub or the awakened tree.

The awakened beast or plant is charmed by you for 30 days or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. When the charmed condition ends, the awakened creature chooses whether to remain friendly to you, based on how you treated it while it was charmed.

### Tek Skills (B)

##### Bane

_1st-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Up to three creatures of your choice that you can see within range must make Charisma saving throws. Whenever a target that fails this saving throw makes an attack roll or a saving throw before the tek skill ends, the target must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.

##### Banishment

_4th-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to send one creature that you can see within range to another plane of existence. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished.

If the target is native to the plane of existence you’re on, you banish the target to a harmless demiplane. While there, the target is incapacitated. The target remains there until the tek skill ends, at which point the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

If the target is native to a different plane of existence than the one you’re on, the target is banished with a faint popping noise, returning to its home plane. If the tek skill ends before 1 minute has passed, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. Otherwise, the target doesn’t return.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th.

##### Barkskin

_2nd-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You touch a willing creature. Until the tek skill ends, the target’s skin has a rough, bark-like appearance, and the target’s AC can’t be less than 16, regardless of what kind of armor it is wearing.

##### Beacon of Hope

_3rd-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

This tek skill bestows hope and vitality. Choose any number of creatures within range. For the duration, each target has advantage on Wisdom saving throws and death saving throws, and regains the maximum number of hit points possible from any healing.

##### Bestow Hack

_3rd-level necromancy_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You touch a creature, and that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become hacked for the duration of the tek skill. When you cast this tek skill, choose the nature of the hack from the following options:

* Choose one ability score. While hacked, the target has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability score.
* While hacked, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against you.
* While hacked, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns. If it fails, it wastes its action that turn doing nothing.
* While the target is hacked, your attacks and tek skills deal an extra 1d8 radiation damage to the target.

A _remove hack_ tek skill ends this effect. At the GM’s option, you may choose an alternative hack effect, but it should be no more powerful than those described above. The GM has final say on such a hack’s effect.

**_At Higher Levels._** If you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 4th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. If you use a tek skill slot of 5th level or higher, the duration is 8 hours. If you use a tek skill slot of 7th level or higher, the duration is 24 hours. If you use a 9th level tek skill slot, the tek skill lasts until it is ditek skilled. Using a tek skill slot of 5th level or higher grants a duration that doesn’t require concentration.

##### Black Tentacles

_4th-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 90 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Squirming, ebony tentacles fill a 20-foot square on ground that you can see within range. For the duration, these tentacles turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.

When a creature enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 bludgeoning damage and be restrained by the tentacles until the tek skill ends. A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already restrained by the tentacles takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage.

A creature restrained by the tentacles can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your tek skill save DC. On a success, it frees itself.

##### Blade Barrier

_6th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 90 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create a vertical wall of whirling, razor-sharp blades made of tek energy. The wall appears within range and lasts for the duration. You can make a straight wall up to 100 feet long, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick, or a ringed wall up to 60 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick. The wall provides three-quarters cover to creatures behind it, and its space is difficult terrain.

When a creature enters the wall’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 6d10 slashing damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.

##### Bless

_1st-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You bless up to three creatures of your choice within range. Whenever a target makes an attack roll or a saving throw before the tek skill ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the attack roll or saving throw.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.

##### Blight

_4th-level necromancy_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Necromantic energy washes over a creature of your choice that you can see within range, draining moisture and vitality from it. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. The target takes 8d8 radiation damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This tek skill has no effect on undead or constructs.

If you target a plant creature or a tek plant, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage, and the tek skill deals maximum damage to it.

If you target a nontek plant that isn’t a creature, such as a tree or shrub, it doesn’t make a saving throw; it simply withers and dies.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.

##### Blindness/Deafness

_2nd-level necromancy_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components**: V

**Duration:** 1 minute

You can blind or deafen a foe. Choose one creature that you can see within range to make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, the target is either blinded or deafened (your choice) for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the tek skill ends.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.

##### Blink

_3rd-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 minute

Roll a d20 at the end of each of your turns for the duration of the tek skill. On a roll of 11 or higher, you vanish from your current plane of existence and appear in the Ethereal Plane (the tek skill fails and the casting is wasted if you were already on that plane). At the start of your next turn, and when the tek skill ends if you are on the Ethereal Plane, you return to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of the space you vanished from. If no unoccupied space is available within that range, you appear in the nearest unoccupied space (chosen at random if more than one space is equally near). You can dismiss this tek skill as an action.

While on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and hear the plane you originated from, which is cast in shades of gray, and you can’t see anything there more than 60 feet away. You can only affect and be affected by other creatures on the Ethereal Plane. Creatures that aren’t there can’t perceive you or interact with you, unless they have the ability to do so.

##### Blur

_2nd-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Your body becomes blurred, shifting and wavering to all who can see you. For the duration, any creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against you. An attacker is immune to this effect if it doesn’t rely on sight, as with blindsight, or can see through illusions, as with truesight.

##### Burning Hands

_1st-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self (15-foot cone)

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

As you hold your hands with thumbs touching and fingers spread, a thin sheet of flames shoots forth from your outstretched fingertips. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

### Tek Skills (C)

##### Call Shock

_3rd-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

A storm cloud appears in the shape of a cylinder that is 10 feet tall with a 60-foot radius, centered on a point you can see 100 feet directly above you. The tek skill fails if you can’t see a point in the air where the storm cloud could appear (for example, if you are in a room that can’t accommodate the cloud).

When you cast the tek skill, choose a point you can see within range. A bolt of lightning flashes down from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On each of your turns until the tek skill ends, you can use your action to call down lightning in this way again, targeting the same point or a different one.

If you are outdoors in stormy conditions when you cast this tek skill, the tek skill gives you control over the existing storm instead of creating a new one. Under such conditions, the tek skill’s damage increases by 1d10.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 4th or higher level, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.

##### Calm Emotions

_2nd-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to suppress strong emotions in a group of people. Each humanoid in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must make a Charisma saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this saving throw if it wishes. If a creature fails its saving throw, choose one of the following two effects.

You can suppress any effect causing a target to be charmed or frightened. When this tek skill ends, any suppressed effect resumes, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.

Alternatively, you can make a target indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a tek skill or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed. When the tek skill ends, the creature becomes hostile again, unless the GM rules otherwise.

##### Chain Shock

_6th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 150 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You create a bolt of lightning that arcs toward a target of your choice that you can see within range. Three bolts then leap from that target to as many as three other targets, each of which must be within 30 feet of the first target. A target can be a creature or an object and can be targeted by only one of the bolts.

A target must make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes 10d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 7th level or higher, one additional bolt leaps from the first target to another target for each slot level above 6th.

##### Charm Person

_1st-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 hour

You attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within range. It must make a Wisdom saving throw, and does so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is charmed by you until the tek skill ends or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. The charmed creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance. When the tek skill ends, the creature knows it was charmed by you.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

##### Chill Touch

_Necromancy cantrip_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 round

You create a ghostly, skeletal hand in the space of a creature within range. Make a ranged tek skill attack against the creature to assail it with the chill of the grave. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 radiation damage, and it can’t regain hit points until the start of your next turn. Until then, the hand clings to the target.

If you hit an undead target, it also has disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the end of your next turn.

This tek skill’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

##### Circle of Death

_6th-level necromancy_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 150 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a gemstone worth at least 50000 credits)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A sphere of negative energy ripples out in a 60-foot* radius sphere from a point within range. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. A target takes 8d6 radiation damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 6th.

##### Clairvoyance

_3rd-level divination_

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes

**Range:** 1 mile

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem worth at least 10,000 credits)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create an invisible sensor within range in a location familiar to you (a place you have visited or seen before) or in an obvious location that is unfamiliar to you (such as behind a door, around a corner, or in a grove of trees). The sensor remains in place for the duration, and it can’t be attacked or otherwise interacted with.

When you cast the tek skill, you choose seeing or hearing. You can use the chosen sense through the sensor as if you were in its space. As your action, you can switch between seeing and hearing.

A creature that can see the sensor (such as a creature benefiting from _see invisibility_ or truesight) sees a luminous, intangible orb about the size of your fist.

##### Clone

_8th-level necromancy_

**Casting Time:** 1 hour

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem worth at least 300,000 credits)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

This tek skill grows an inert duplicate of a living creature as a safeguard against death. This clone forms inside a sealed vessel and grows to full size and maturity after 120 days; you can also choose to have the clone be a younger version of the same creature. It remains inert and endures indefinitely, as long as its vessel remains undisturbed.

At any time after the clone matures, if the original creature dies, its soul transfers to the clone, provided that the soul is free and willing to return.

The clone is physically identical to the original and has the same personality, memories, and abilities, but none of the original’s equipment. The original creature’s physical remains, if they still exist, become inert and can’t thereafter be restored to life, since the creature’s soul is elsewhere.

##### Cloudkill

_5th-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of poisonous, yellow-green fog centered on a point you choose within range. The fog spreads around corners. It lasts for the duration or until strong wind disperses the fog, ending the tek skill. Its area is heavily obscured.

When a creature enters the tek skill’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 5d8 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don’t need to breathe.

The fog moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns, rolling along the surface of the ground. The vapors, being heavier than air, sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down openings.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.

##### Color Spray

_1st-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self (15-foot cone)

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 round

A dazzling array of flashing, colored light springs from your hand. Roll 6d10; the total is how many hit points of creatures this tek skill can effect. Creatures in a 15-foot cone originating from you are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures and creatures that can’t see).

Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this tek skill is blinded until the tek skill ends. Subtract each creature’s hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature’s hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional 2d10 for each slot level above 1st.

##### Command

_1st-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V

**Duration:** 1 round

You speak a one-word command to a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or follow the command on its next turn. The tek skill has no effect if the target is undead, if it doesn’t understand your language, or if your command is directly harmful to it.

Some typical commands and their effects follow. You might issue a command other than one described here. If you do so, the GM determines how the target behaves. If the target can’t follow your command, the tek skill ends.

**_Approach._** The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you.

**_Drop._** The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn.

**_Flee._** The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means.

**_Grovel._** The target falls prone and then ends its turn.

**_Halt._** The target doesn’t move and takes no actions.

A flying creature stays aloft, provided that it is able to do so. If it must move to stay aloft, it flies the minimum distance needed to remain in the air.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect one additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

##### Commune

_5th-level divination (ritual)_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 minute

You contact your deity or a divine proxy and ask up to three questions that can be answered with a yes or no. You must ask your questions before the tek skill ends. You receive a correct answer for each question.

Divine beings aren’t necessarily omniscient, so you might receive “unclear” as an answer if a question pertains to information that lies beyond the deity’s knowledge. In a case where a one-word answer could be misleading or contrary to the deity’s interests, the GM might offer a short phrase as an answer instead.

If you cast the tek skill two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer. The GM makes this roll in secret.

##### Commune with Nature

_5th-level divination (ritual)_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You briefly become one with nature and gain knowledge of the surrounding territory. In the outdoors, the tek skill gives you knowledge of the land within 3 miles of you. In caves and other natural underground settings, the radius is limited to 300 feet. The tek skill doesn’t function where nature has been replaced by construction, such as in dungeons and towns.

You instantly gain knowledge of up to three facts of your choice about any of the following subjects as they relate to the area:

* terrain and bodies of water
* prevalent plants, minerals, animals, or peoples
* powerful celestials, fey, fiends, elementals, or undead
* influence from other planes of existence
* buildings

For example, you could determine the location of powerful undead in the area, the location of major sources of safe drinking water, and the location of any nearby towns.

##### Comprehend Languages

_1st-level divination (ritual)_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 hour

For the duration, you understand the literal meaning of any spoken language that you hear. You also understand any written language that you see, but you must be touching the surface on which the words are written. It takes about 1 minute to read one page of text.

This tek skill doesn’t decode secret messages in a text or a glyph, such as an arcane sigil, that isn’t part of a written language.

##### Cone of Cold

_5th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self (60-foot cone)

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A blast of cold air erupts from your hands. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 8d8 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

A creature killed by this tek skill becomes a frozen statue until it thaws.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.

##### Confusion

_4th-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 90 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

This tek skill assaults and twists creatures’ minds, spawning delusions and provoking uncontrolled action. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this tek skill or be affected by it.

An affected target can’t take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.

| d10  | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | The creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face. The creature doesn’t take an action this turn. |
| 2–6  | The creature doesn’t move or take actions this turn.                                                                                                                                            |
| 7–8  | The creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn.     |
| 9–10 | The creature can act and move normally.                                                                                                                                                         |

At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 5th level or higher, the radius of the sphere increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 4th.

The summoned creatures are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions.

The GM has the creatures’ statistics.

You mentally contact a demigod, the spirit of a long-dead sage, or some other mysterious entity from another plane. Contacting this extraplanar intelligence can strain or even break your mind. When you cast this tek skill, make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, you take 6d6 psychic damage and are insane until you finish a long rest. While insane, you can’t take actions, can’t understand what other creatures say, can’t read, and speak only in gibberish. A _greater restoration_ tek skill cast on you ends this effect.

On a successful save, you can ask the entity up to five questions. You must ask your questions before the tek skill ends. The GM answers each question with one word, such as “yes,” “no,” “maybe,” “never,” “irrelevant,” or “unclear” (if the entity doesn’t know the answer to the question). If a one-word answer would be misleading, the GM might instead offer a short phrase as an answer.

##### Contagion

_5th-level necromancy_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Component:** V, S

**Duration:** 7 days

Your touch inflicts disease. Make a melee tek skill attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, you afflict the creature with a disease of your choice from any of the ones described below.

At the end of each of the target’s turns, it must make a Constitution saving throw. After failing three of these saving throws, the disease’s effects last for the duration, and the creature stops making these saves. After succeeding on three of these saving throws, the creature recovers from the disease, and the tek skill ends.

Since this tek skill induces a natural disease in its target, any effect that removes a disease or otherwise ameliorates a disease’s effects apply to it.

**_Blinding Sickness._** Pain grips the creature’s mind, and its eyes turn milky white. The creature has disadvantage on Wisdom checks and Wisdom saving throws and is blinded.

**_Filth Fever._** A raging fever sweeps through the creature’s body. The creature has disadvantage on Strength checks, Strength saving throws, and attack rolls that use Strength.

**_Flesh Rot._** The creature’s flesh decays. The creature has disadvantage on Charisma checks and vulnerability to all damage.

**_Mindfire._** The creature’s mind becomes feverish. The creature has disadvantage on Intelligence checks and Intelligence saving throws, and the creature behaves as if under the effects of the _confusion_ tek skill during combat.

**_Seizure._** The creature is overcome with shaking. The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity checks, Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls that use Dexterity.

**_Slimy Doom._** The creature begins to bleed uncontrollably. The creature has disadvantage on Constitution checks and Constitution saving throws. In addition, whenever the creature takes damage, it is stunned until the end of its next turn.

##### Contingency

_6th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem worth at least 150,000 credits)

**Duration:** 10 days

Choose a tek skill of 5th level or lower that you can cast, that has a casting time of 1 action, and that can target you. You cast that tek skill—called the contingent tek skill—as part of casting _contingency_, expending tek skill slots for both, but the contingent tek skill doesn’t come into effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain circumstance occurs. You describe that circumstance when you cast the two tek skills. For example, a _contingency_ cast with _water breathing_ might stipulate that _water breathing_ comes into effect when you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.

The contingent tek skill takes effect immediately after the circumstance is met for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and then _contingency_ ends.

The contingent tek skill takes effect only on you, even if it can normally target others. You can use only one _contingency_ tek skill at a time. If you cast this tek skill again, the effect of another _contingency_ tek skill on you ends. Also, _contingency_ ends on you if its material component is ever not on your person.

##### Continual Flame

_2nd-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem worth 5000 credits, which the tek skill consumes)

**Duration:** Until ditek skilled

A flame, equivalent in brightness to a torch, springs forth from an object that you touch. The effect looks like a regular flame, but it creates no heat and doesn’t use oxygen. A _continual flame_ can be covered or hidden but not smothered or quenched.

##### Control Water

_4th-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 300 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Until the tek skill ends, you control any freestanding water inside an area you choose that is a cube up to 100 feet on a side. You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this tek skill. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.

**_Flood._** You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land.

If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave’s path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.

The water level remains elevated until the tek skill ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.

**_Part Water._** You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the tek skill’s area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the tek skill ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.

**_Redirect Flow._** You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the tek skill’s area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the tek skill ends or you choose a different effect.

**_Whirlpool._** This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Physique) check against your tek skill save DC.

When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the tek skill ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn’t caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Physique) check to do so.

The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.

##### Control Weather

_8th-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes

**Range:** Self (5-mile radius)

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 8 hours

You take control of the weather within 5 miles of you for the duration. You must be outdoors to cast this tek skill. Moving to a place where you don’t have a clear path to the sky ends the tek skill early.

When you cast the tek skill, you change the current weather conditions, which are determined by the GM based on the climate and season. You can change precipitation, temperature, and wind. It takes 1d4 × 10 minutes for the new conditions to take effect. Once they do so, you can change the conditions again. When the tek skill ends, the weather gradually returns to normal.

When you change the weather conditions, find a current condition on the following tables and change its stage by one, up or down. When changing the wind, you can change its direction.

**Precipitation (table)**

| Stage | Condition                                  |
|-------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Clear                                      |
| 2     | Light clouds                               |
| 3     | Overcast or ground fog                     |
| 4     | Rain, hail, or snow                        |
| 5     | Torrential rain, driving hail, or blizzard |

**Temperature (table)**

| Stage | Condition       |
|-------|-----------------|
| 1     | Unbearable heat |
| 2     | Hot             |
| 3     | Warm            |
| 4     | Cool            |
| 5     | Cold            |
| 6     | Arctic cold     |

**Wind (table)**

| Stage | Condition     |
|-------|---------------|
| 1     | Calm          |
| 2     | Moderate wind |
| 3     | Strong wind   |
| 4     | Gale          |
| 5     | Storm         |

##### Create Food and Water

_3rd-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You create 45 pounds of food and 30 gallons of water on the ground or in containers within range, enough to sustain up to fifteen humanoids or five steeds for 24 hours. The food is bland but nourishing, and spoils if uneaten after 24 hours. The water is clean and doesn’t go bad.

##### Create or Destroy Water

_1st-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You either create or destroy water.

**_Create Water._** You create up to 10 gallons of clean water within range in an open container. Alternatively, the water falls as rain in a 30-foot cube within range, extinguishing exposed flames in the area.

**_Destroy Water._** You destroy up to 10 gallons of water in an open container within range. Alternatively, you destroy fog in a 30-foot cube within range.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 2nd level or higher, you create or destroy 10 additional gallons of water, or the size of the cube increases by 5 feet, for each slot level above 1st.

##### Create Undead

_6th-level necromancy_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** 10 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem worth 15000 credits for each corpse)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You can cast this tek skill only at night. Choose up to three corpses of Medium or Small humanoids within range. Each corpse becomes a ghoul under your control. (The GM has game statistics for these creatures.)

As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can mentally command any creature you animated with this tek skill if the creature is within 120 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.

The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you have given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this tek skill on the creature before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the tek skill reasserts your control over up to three creatures you have animated with this tek skill, rather than animating new ones.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a 7th-level tek skill slot, you can animate or reassert control over four ghouls. When you cast this tek skill using an 8th-level tek skill slot, you can animate or reassert control over five ghouls or two ghasts or wights. When you cast this tek skill using a 9th-level tek skill slot, you can animate or reassert control over six ghouls, three ghasts or wights, or two mummies.

##### Creation

_5th-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Special

You pull wisps of shadow material from the Shadowfell to create a nonliving object of vegetable matter within range: soft goods, rope, wood, or something similar. You can also use this tek skill to create mineral objects such as stone, crystal, or metal. The object created must be no larger than a 5* foot cube, and the object must be of a form and material that you have seen before.

The duration depends on the object’s material. If the object is composed of multiple materials, use the shortest duration.

| Material              | Duration   |
|-----------------------|------------|
| Vegetable matter      | 1 day      |
| Stone or crystal      | 12 hours   |
| Precious metals       | 1 hour     |
| Gems                  | 10 minutes |
| Adamantine or mithral | 1 minute   |

Using any material created by this tek skill as another tek skill’s material component causes that tek skill to fail.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 6th level or higher, the cube increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 5th.

##### Cure Wounds

_1st-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A creature you touch regains a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + your Tekcasting ability modifier. This tek skill has no effect on undead or constructs.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 2nd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

### Tek Skills (D)

##### Dancing Lights

_Evocation cantrip_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create up to four torch-sized lights within range, making them appear as torches, lanterns, or glowing orbs that hover in the air for the duration. You can also combine the four lights into one glowing vaguely humanoid form of Medium size. Whichever form you choose, each light sheds dim light in a 10* foot radius.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights up to 60 feet to a new spot within range. A light must be within 20 feet of another light created by this tek skill, and a light winks out if it exceeds the tek skill’s range.

##### Darkness

_2nd-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Tek darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 15-foot-radius sphere for the duration. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can’t see through this darkness, and nontek light can’t illuminate it.

If the point you choose is on an object you are holding or one that isn’t being worn or carried, the darkness emanates from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the source of the darkness with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the darkness.

If any of this tek skill’s area overlaps with an area of light created by a tek skill of 2nd level or lower, the tek skill that created the light is ditek skilled.

##### Darkvision

_2nd-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 8 hours

You touch a willing creature to grant it the ability to see in the dark. For the duration, that creature has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.

##### Daylight

_3rd-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 hour

A 60-foot-radius sphere of light spreads out from a point you choose within range. The sphere is bright light and sheds dim light for an additional 60 feet.

If you chose a point on an object you are holding or one that isn’t being worn or carried, the light shines from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the affected object with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the light.

If any of this tek skill’s area overlaps with an area of darkness created by a tek skill of 3rd level or lower, the tek skill that created the darkness is ditek skilled.

##### Death Ward

_4th-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 8 hours

You touch a creature and grant it a measure of protection from death.

The first time the target would drop to 0 hit points as a result of taking damage, the target instead drops to 1 hit point, and the tek skill ends.

If the tek skill is still in effect when the target is subjected to an effect that would kill it instantaneously without dealing damage, that effect is instead negated against the target, and the tek skill ends.

##### Delayed Blast Fireball

_7th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 150 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A beam of yellow light flashes from your pointing finger, then condenses to linger at a chosen point within range as a glowing bead for the duration. When the tek skill ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it, the bead blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame that spreads around corners. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes fire damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The tek skill’s base damage is 12d6. If at the end of your turn the bead has not yet detonated, the damage increases by 1d6.

If the glowing bead is touched before the interval has expired, the creature touching it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the tek skill ends immediately, causing the bead to erupt in flame. On a successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet. When it strikes a creature or a solid object, the tek skill ends, and the bead explodes.

The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 8th level or higher, the base damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 7th.

##### Demiplane

_8th-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** S

**Duration:** 1 hour

You create a shadowy door on a flat solid surface that you can see within range. The door is large enough to allow Medium creatures to pass through unhindered. When opened, the door leads to a demiplane that appears to be an empty room 30 feet in each dimension, made of wood or stone. When the tek skill ends, the door disappears, and any creatures or objects inside the demiplane remain trapped there, as the door also disappears from the other side.

Each time you cast this tek skill, you can create a new demiplane, or have the shadowy door connect to a demiplane you created with a previous casting of this tek skill. Additionally, if you know the nature and contents of a demiplane created by a casting of this tek skill by another creature, you can have the shadowy door connect to its demiplane instead.

##### Detect Evil and Good

_1st-level divination_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

For the duration, you know if there is an aberration, celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead within 30 feet of you, as well as where the creature is located. Similarly, you know if there is a place or object within 30 feet of you that has been consecrated or desecrated.

The tek skill can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

##### Detect Tek

_1st-level divination (ritual)_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

For the duration, you sense the presence of tek within 30 feet of you. If you sense tek in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears tek, and you learn its school of tek, if any.

The tek skill can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

##### Detect Poison and Disease

_1st-level divination (ritual)_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

For the duration, you can sense the presence and location of poisons, poisonous creatures, and diseases within 30 feet of you. You also identify the kind of poison, poisonous creature, or disease in each case.

The tek skill can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

##### Detect Thoughts

_2nd-level divination_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

For the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain creatures. When you cast the tek skill and as your action on each turn until the tek skill ends, you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn’t speak any language, the creature is unaffected.

You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature—what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature’s mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the tek skill ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the tek skill ends.

Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this tek skill is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.

You can also use this tek skill to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can’t see. When you cast the tek skill or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The tek skill can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can’t detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn’t speak any language.

Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can’t see it, but it must still be within range.

##### Dimension Door

_4th-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 500 feet

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You teleport yourself from your current location to any other spot within range. You arrive at exactly the spot desired. It can be a place you can see, one you can visualize, or one you can describe by stating distance and direction, such as “200 feet straight downward” or “upward to the northwest at a 45* degree angle, 300 feet.”

You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn’t exceed what you can carry. You can also bring one willing creature of your size or smaller who is carrying gear up to its carrying capacity. The creature must be within 5 feet of you when you cast this tek skill.

If you would arrive in a place already occupied by an object or a creature, you and any creature traveling with you each take 4d6 force damage, and the tek skill fails to teleport you.

##### Disguise Self

_1st-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 hour

You make yourself—including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person— look different until the tek skill ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.

The changes wrought by this tek skill fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this tek skill to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this tek skill to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.

To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tek skill save DC.

##### Disintegrate

_6th-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A thin green ray springs from your pointing finger to a target that you can see within range. The target can be a creature, an object, or a creation of tek force, such as the wall created by _wall of force_.

A creature targeted by this tek skill must make a

Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 10d6 + 40 force damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated.

A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except alien artifacts, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a _true resurrection_ or a _wish_ tek skill.

This tek skill automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nontek object or a creation of tek force. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of force, this tek skill disintegrates a 10-foot* cube portion of it. A alien artifact is unaffected by this tek skill.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 3d6 for each slot level above 6th.

##### Dispel Evil and Good

_5th-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Shimmering energy surrounds and protects you from fey, undead, and creatures originating from beyond the Material Plane. For the duration, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead have disadvantage on attack rolls against you.

You can end the tek skill early by using either of the following special functions.

**_Break Enchantment._** As your action, you touch a creature you can reach that is charmed, frightened, or possessed by a celestial, an elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an undead. The creature you touch is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed by such creatures.

**_Dismissal._** As your action, make a melee tek skill attack against a celestial, an elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an undead you can reach. On a hit, you attempt to drive the creature back to its home plane. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be sent back to its home plane (if it isn’t there already). If they aren’t on their home plane, undead are sent to the Shadowfell, and fey are sent to the Feywild.

##### Dispel Tek

_3rd-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Choose one creature, object, or tek effect within range. Any tek skill of 3rd level or lower on the target ends. For each tek skill of 4th level or higher on the target, make an ability check using your Tekcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the tek skill’s level. On a successful check, the tek skill ends.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 4th level or higher, you automatically end the effects of a tek skill on the target if the tek skill’s level is equal to or less than the level of the tek skill slot you used.

##### Divination

_4th-level divination (ritual)_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem worth at least 2,500 credits)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Your tek and an offering put you in contact with a god or a god’s servants. You ask a single question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within 7 days. The GM offers a truthful reply. The reply might be a short phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen.

The tek skill doesn’t take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional tek skills or the loss or gain of a companion.

If you cast the tek skill two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The GM makes this roll in secret.

##### Divine Favor

_1st-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Your prayer empowers you with divine radiance. Until the tek skill ends, your weapon attacks deal an extra 1d4 radiant damage on a hit.

##### Divine Word

_7th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You utter a divine word, imbued with the power that shaped the world at the dawn of creation. Choose any number of creatures you can see within range. Each creature that can hear you must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature suffers an effect based on its current hit points:

* 50 hit points or fewer: deafened for 1 minute
* 40 hit points or fewer: deafened and blinded for 10 minutes
* 30 hit points or fewer: blinded, deafened, and stunned for 1 hour
* 20 hit points or fewer: killed instantly Regardless of its current hit points, a celestial, an elemental, a fey, or a fiend that fails its save is forced back to its plane of origin (if it isn’t there already) and can’t return to your current plane for 24 hours by any means short of a _wish_ tek skill.

##### Dominate Beast

_4th-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to beguile a beast that you can see within range. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw.

While the beast is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as “Attack that creature,” “Run over there,” or “Fetch that object.” If the creature completes the order and doesn’t receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.

You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn’t do anything that you don’t allow it to do. During this time, you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.

Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the tek skill. If the saving throw succeeds, the tek skill ends.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill with a 5th-level tek skill slot, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. When you use a 6th-level tek skill slot, the duration is concentration, up to 1 hour. When you use a tek skill slot of 7th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 8 hours.

##### Dominate Person

_5th-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to beguile a humanoid that you can see within range. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw.

When you use a 7th-level tek skill slot, the duration is concentration, up to 1 hour. When you use a tek skill slot of 8th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 8 hours.

##### Dream

_5th-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** Special

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 8 hours

This tek skill shapes a creature’s dreams. Choose a creature known to you as the target of this tek skill. The target must be on the same plane of existence as you. Creatures that don’t sleep, such as elves, can’t be contacted by this tek skill. You, or a willing creature you touch, enters a trance state, acting as a messenger. While in the trance, the messenger is aware of his or her surroundings, but can’t take actions or move.

If the target is asleep, the messenger appears in the target’s dreams and can converse with the target as long as it remains asleep, through the duration of the tek skill. The messenger can also shape the environment of the dream, creating landscapes, objects, and other images. The messenger can emerge from the trance at any time, ending the effect of the tek skill early. The target recalls the dream perfectly upon waking. If the target is awake when you cast the tek skill, the messenger knows it, and can either end the trance (and the tek skill) or wait for the target to fall asleep, at which point the messenger appears in the target’s dreams.

You can make the messenger appear monstrous and terrifying to the target. If you do, the messenger can deliver a message of no more than ten words and then the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, echoes of the phantasmal monstrosity spawn a nightmare that lasts the duration of the target’s sleep and prevents the target from gaining any benefit from that rest. In addition, when the target wakes up, it takes 3d6 psychic damage.

If you have a body part, lock of hair, clipping from a nail, or similar portion of the target’s body, the target makes its saving throw with disadvantage.

### Tek Skills (E)

##### Earthquake

_8th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 500 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a seismic disturbance at a point on the ground that you can see within range. For the duration, an intense tremor rips through the ground in a 100-foot-radius circle centered on that point and shakes creatures and structures in contact with the ground in that area.

The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain.

Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature’s concentration is broken.

When you cast this tek skill and at the end of each turn you spend concentrating on it, each creature on the ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.

This tek skill can have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area, as determined by the GM.

**_Fissures._** Fissures open throughout the tek skill’s area at the start of your next turn after you cast the tek skill. A total of 1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the GM. Each is 1d10 × 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the tek skill’s area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure’s edge as it opens.

A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse (see below).

**_Structures._** The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the tek skill and at the start of each of your turns until the tek skill ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure’s height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Physique) check as an action to escape. The GM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn’t fall prone or become buried.

##### Enhance Ability

_2nd-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour.

You touch a creature and bestow upon it a tek enhancement. Choose one of the following effects; the target gains that effect until the tek skill ends.

**_Bear’s Endurance._** The target has advantage on Constitution checks. It also gains 2d6 temporary hit points, which are lost when the tek skill ends.

**_Bull’s Strength._** The target has advantage on Strength checks, and his or her carrying capacity doubles.

**_Cat’s Grace._** The target has advantage on Dexterity checks. It also doesn’t take damage from falling 20 feet or less if it isn’t incapacitated.

**_Eagle’s Splendor._** The target has advantage on Charisma checks.

**_Fox’s Cunning._** The target has advantage on Intelligence checks.

**_Owl’s Wisdom._** The target has advantage on Wisdom checks.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.

##### Enlarge/Reduce

_2nd-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You cause a creature or an object you can see within range to grow larger or smaller for the duration. Choose either a creature or an object that is neither worn nor carried. If the target is unwilling, it can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the tek skill has no effect.

If the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and carrying changes size with it. Any item dropped by an affected creature returns to normal size at once.

**_Enlarge._** The target’s size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases its size by one category— from Medium to Large, for example. If there isn’t enough room for the target to double its size, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size in the space available. Until the tek skill ends, the target also has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target’s weapons also grow to match its new size. While these weapons are enlarged, the target’s attacks with them deal 1d4 extra damage.

**_Reduce._** The target’s size is halved in all dimensions, and its weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal. This reduction decreases its size by one category—from Medium to Small, for example. Until the tek skill ends, the target also has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target’s weapons also shrink to match its new size. While these weapons are reduced, the target’s attacks with them deal 1d4 less damage (this can’t reduce the damage below 1).

##### Entangle

_1st-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 90 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Grasping weeds and vines sprout from the ground in a 20-foot square starting from a point within range. For the duration, these plants turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.

A creature in the area when you cast the tek skill must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the entangling plants until the tek skill ends. A creature restrained by the plants can use its action to make a Strength check against your tek skill save DC. On a success, it frees itself.

When the tek skill ends, the conjured plants wilt away.

##### Enthrall

_2nd-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 minute

You weave a distracting string of words, causing creatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can hear you to make a Wisdom saving throw. Any creature that can’t be charmed succeeds on this saving throw automatically, and if you or your companions are fighting a creature, it has advantage on the save. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to perceive any creature other than you until the tek skill ends or until the target can no longer hear you. The tek skill ends if you are incapacitated or can no longer speak.

##### Etherealness

_7th-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Up to 8 hours

You step into the border regions of the Ethereal Plane, in the area where it overlaps with your current plane. You remain in the Border Ethereal for the duration or until you use your action to dismiss the tek skill. During this time, you can move in any direction. If you move up or down, every foot of movement costs an extra foot. You can see and hear the plane you originated from, but everything there looks gray, and you can’t see anything more than 60 feet away.

While on the Ethereal Plane, you can only affect and be affected by other creatures on that plane. Creatures that aren’t on the Ethereal Plane can’t perceive you and can’t interact with you, unless a special ability or tek has given them the ability to do so.

You ignore all objects and effects that aren’t on the Ethereal Plane, allowing you to move through objects you perceive on the plane you originated from.

When the tek skill ends, you immediately return to the plane you originated from in the spot you currently occupy. If you occupy the same spot as a solid object or creature when this happens, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you are moved.

This tek skill has no effect if you cast it while you are on the Ethereal Plane or a plane that doesn’t border it, such as one of the Outer Planes.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 8th level or higher, you can target up to three willing creatures (including you) for each slot level above 7th. The creatures must be within 10 feet of you when you cast the tek skill.

##### Expeditious Retreat

_1st-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

This tek skill allows you to move at an incredible pace. When you cast this tek skill, and then as a bonus action on each of your turns until the tek skill ends, you can take the Dash action.

##### Eyebite

_6th-level necromancy_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

For the tek skill’s duration, your eyes become an inky void imbued with dread power. One creature of your choice within 60 feet of you that you can see must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by one of the following effects of your choice for the duration. On each of your turns until the tek skill ends, you can use your action to target another creature but can’t target a creature again if it has succeeded on a saving throw against this casting of _eyebite_.

**_Asleep._** The target falls unconscious. It wakes up if it takes any damage or if another creature uses its action to shake the sleeper awake.

**_Panicked._** The target is frightened of you. On each of its turns, the frightened creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest and shortest available route, unless there is nowhere to move. If the target moves to a place at least 60 feet away from you where it can no longer see you, this effect ends.

**_Sickened._** The target has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. At the end of each of its turns, it can make another Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, the effect ends.

### Tek Skills (F)

##### Fabricate

_4th-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You convert raw materials into products of the same material. For example, you can fabricate a wooden bridge from a clump of trees, a rope from a patch of hemp, and clothes from flax or wool.

Choose raw materials that you can see within range. You can fabricate a Large or smaller object (contained within a 10-foot cube, or eight connected 5-foot cubes), given a sufficient quantity of raw material. If you are working with metal, stone, or another mineral substance, however, the fabricated object can be no larger than Medium (contained within a single 5-foot cube). The quality of objects made by the tek skill is commensurate with the quality of the raw materials.

Creatures or alien artifacts can’t be created or transmuted by this tek skill. You also can’t use it to create items that ordinarily require a high degree of craftsmanship, such as jewelry, weapons, glass, or armor, unless you have proficiency with the type of artisan’s tools used to craft such objects.

##### Faerie Fire

_1st-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Each object in a 20-foot cube within range is outlined in blue, green, or violet light (your choice). Any creature in the area when the tek skill is cast is also outlined in light if it fails a Dexterity saving throw. For the duration, objects and affected creatures shed dim light in a 10-foot radius.

Any attack roll against an affected creature or object has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected creature or object can’t benefit from being invisible.

##### Faithful Hound

_4th-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 8 hours

You conjure a phantom watchdog in an unoccupied space that you can see within range, where it remains for the duration, until you dismiss it as an action, or until you move more than 100 feet away from it.

The hound is invisible to all creatures except you and can’t be harmed. When a Small or larger creature comes within 30 feet of it without first speaking the password that you specify when you cast this tek skill, the hound starts barking loudly. The hound sees invisible creatures and can see into the Ethereal Plane. It ignores illusions.

At the start of each of your turns, the hound attempts to bite one creature within 5 feet of it that is hostile to you. The hound’s attack bonus is equal to your Tekcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a hit, it deals 4d8 piercing damage.

##### False Life

_1st-level necromancy_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 hour

Bolstering yourself with a necromantic facsimile of life, you gain 1d4 + 4 temporary hit points for the duration.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 2nd level or higher, you gain 5 additional temporary hit points for each slot level above 1st.

##### Fear

_3rd-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self (30-foot cone)

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You project a phantasmal image of a creature’s worst fears. Each creature in a 30-foot cone must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or drop whatever it is holding and become frightened for the duration.

While frightened by this tek skill, a creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn’t have line of sight to you, the creature can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the tek skill ends for that creature.

##### Feather Fall

_1st-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you or a creature within 60 feet of you falls

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V

**Duration:** 1 minute

Choose up to five falling creatures within range. A falling creature’s rate of descent slows to 60 feet per round until the tek skill ends. If the creature lands before the tek skill ends, it takes no falling damage and can land on its feet, and the tek skill ends for that creature.

##### Feeblemind

_8th-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 150 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You blast the mind of a creature that you can see within range, attempting to shatter its intellect and personality. The target takes 4d6 psychic damage and must make an Intelligence saving throw.

On a failed save, the creature’s Intelligence and Charisma scores become 1. The creature can’t cast tek skills, activate alien artifacts, understand language, or communicate in any intelligible way. The creature can, however, identify its friends, follow them, and even protect them.

At the end of every 30 days, the creature can repeat its saving throw against this tek skill. If it succeeds on its saving throw, the tek skill ends.

The tek skill can also be ended by _greater restoration_, _heal_, or _wish_.

##### Find Steed

_2nd-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You summon a spirit that assumes the form of an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal steed, creating a long-lasting bond with it. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the steed takes on a form that you choose: a warhorse, a pony, a camel, an elk, or a mastiff. (Your GM might allow other animals to be summoned as steeds.) The steed has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of its normal type. Additionally, if your steed has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.

Your steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit. While mounted on your steed, you can make any tek skill you cast that targets only you also target your steed.

When the steed drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. You can also dismiss your steed at any time as an action, causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this tek skill again summons the same steed, restored to its hit point maximum.

While your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically.

You can’t have more than one steed bonded by this tek skill at a time. As an action, you can release the steed from its bond at any time, causing it to disappear.

##### Find the Path

_6th-level divination_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem worth at least 10,000 credits)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 day

This tek skill allows you to find the shortest, most direct physical route to a specific fixed location that you are familiar with on the same plane of existence. If you name a destination on another plane of existence, a destination that moves (such as a mobile fortress), or a destination that isn’t specific (such as “a green dragon’s lair”), the tek skill fails.

For the duration, as long as you are on the same plane of existence as the destination, you know how far it is and in what direction it lies. While you are traveling there, whenever you are presented with a choice of paths along the way, you automatically determine which path is the shortest and most direct route (but not necessarily the safest route) to the destination.

##### Find Traps

_2nd-level divination_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You sense the presence of any trap within range that is within line of sight. A trap, for the purpose of this tek skill, includes anything that would inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable, which was specifically intended as such by its creator. Thus, the tek skill would sense an area affected by the _alarm_ tek skill, a _glyph of warding_, or a mechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.

This tek skill merely reveals that a trap is present.

You don’t learn the location of each trap, but you do learn the general nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense.

##### Finger of Death

_7th-level necromancy_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You send negative energy coursing through a creature that you can see within range, causing it searing pain. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 7d8 + 30 radiation damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

A humanoid killed by this tek skill rises at the start of your next turn as a zombie that is permanently under your command, following your verbal orders to the best of its ability.

##### Fireball

_3rd-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 150 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

##### Fire Shield

_4th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 10 minutes

Thin and wispy flames wreathe your body for the duration, shedding bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can end the tek skill early by using an action to dismiss it.

The flames provide you with a warm shield or a chill shield, as you choose. The warm shield grants you resistance to cold damage, and the chill shield grants you resistance to fire damage.

In addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the shield erupts with flame. The attacker takes 2d8 fire damage from a warm shield, or 2d8 cold damage from a cold shield.

##### Fire Storm

_7th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 150 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A storm made up of sheets of roaring flame appears in a location you choose within range. The area of the storm consists of up to ten 10-foot cubes, which you can arrange as you wish. Each cube must have at least one face adjacent to the face of another cube. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 7d10 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried. If you choose, plant life in the area is unaffected by this tek skill.

##### Flame Blade

_2nd-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You evoke a fiery blade in your free hand. The blade is similar in size and shape to a scimitar, and it lasts for the duration. If you let go of the blade, it disappears, but you can evoke the blade again as a bonus action.

You can use your action to make a melee tek skill attack with the fiery blade. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 fire damage.

The flaming blade sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for every two slot levels above 2nd.

##### Flame Strike

_5th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A vertical column of divine fire roars down from the heavens in a location you specify. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d6 fire damage and 4d6 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 6th level or higher, the fire damage or the radiant damage (your choice) increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 5th.

##### Flaming Sphere

_2nd-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A 5-foot-diameter sphere of fire appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within range and lasts for the duration. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

As a bonus action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet. If you ram the sphere into a creature, that creature must make the saving throw against the sphere’s damage, and the sphere stops moving this turn.

When you move the sphere, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet tall and jump it across pits up to 10 feet wide. The sphere ignites flammable objects not being worn or carried, and it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.

##### Flesh to Stone

_6th-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to turn one creature that you can see within range into stone. If the target’s body is made of flesh, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is restrained as its flesh begins to harden. On a successful save, the creature isn’t affected.

A creature restrained by this tek skill must make another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves against this tek skill three times, the tek skill ends. If it fails its saves three times, it is turned to stone and subjected to the petrified condition for the duration. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.

If the creature is physically broken while petrified, it suffers from similar deformities if it reverts to its original state.

If you maintain your concentration on this tek skill for the entire possible duration, the creature is turned to stone until the effect is removed.

##### Floating Disk

_1st-level conjuration (ritual)_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 hour

This tek skill creates a circular, horizontal plane of force, 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet above the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The disk remains for the duration, and can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight is placed on it, the tek skill ends, and everything on the disk falls to the ground.

The disk is immobile while you are within 20 feet of it. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, the disk follows you so that it remains within 20 feet of you. It can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes and the like, but it can’t cross an elevation change of 10 feet or more. For example, the disk can’t move across a 10-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was created at the bottom.

If you move more than 100 feet from the disk (typically because it can’t move around an obstacle to follow you), the tek skill ends.

##### Fly

_3rd-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You touch a willing creature. The target gains a flying speed of 60 feet for the duration. When the tek skill ends, the target falls if it is still aloft, unless it can stop the fall.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.

##### Fog Cloud

_1st-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of fog centered on a point within range. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 2nd level or higher, the radius of the fog increases by 20 feet for each slot level above 1st.

##### Forbiddance

_6th-level abjuration (ritual)_

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem worth at least 100,000 credits)

**Duration:** 1 day

You create a ward against tek travel that protects up to 40,000 square feet of floor space to a height of 30 feet above the floor. For the duration, creatures can’t teleport into the area or use portals, such as those created by the _gate_ tek skill, to enter the area. The tek skill proofs the area against planar travel, and therefore prevents creatures from accessing the area by way of the Astral Plane, Ethereal Plane, Feywild, Shadowfell, or the _plane shift_ tek skill.

In addition, the tek skill damages types of creatures that you choose when you cast it. Choose one or more of the following: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. When a chosen creature enters the tek skill’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature takes 5d10 radiant or radiation damage (your choice when you cast this tek skill).

When you cast this tek skill, you can designate a password. A creature that speaks the password as it enters the area takes no damage from the tek skill.

The tek skill’s area can’t overlap with the area of another _forbiddance_ tek skill. If you cast _forbiddance_ every day for 30 days in the same location, the tek skill lasts until it is ditek skilled, and the material components are consumed on the last casting.

##### Forcecage

_7th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 100 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem worth 150,000 credits)

**Duration:** 1 hour

An immobile, invisible, cube-shaped prison composed of tek force springs into existence around an area you choose within range. The prison can be a cage or a solid box, as you choose.

A prison in the shape of a cage can be up to 20 feet on a side and is made from 1/2-inch diameter bars spaced 1/2 inch apart.

A prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any tek skills cast into or out from the area.

When you cast the tek skill, any creature that is completely inside the cage’s area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the area.

A creature inside the cage can’t leave it by nontek means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature can use that tek to exit the cage. On a failure, the creature can’t exit the cage and wastes the use of the tek skill or effect. The cage also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.

This tek skill can’t be ditek skilled by _dispel tek_.

##### Foresight

_9th-level divination_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 8 hours

You touch a willing creature and bestow a limited ability to see into the immediate future. For the duration, the target can’t be surprised and has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. Additionally, other creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target for the duration.

This tek skill immediately ends if you cast it again before its duration ends.

##### Freedom of Movement

_4th-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 hour

You touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target’s movement is unaffected by difficult terrain, and tek skills and other tek effects can neither reduce the target’s speed nor cause the target to be paralyzed or restrained.

The target can also spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from nontek restraints, such as manacles or a creature that has it grappled. Finally, being underwater imposes no penalties on the target’s movement or attacks.

##### Freezing Sphere

_6th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 300 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A frigid globe of cold energy streaks from your fingertips to a point of your choice within range, where it explodes in a 60-foot-radius sphere. Each creature within the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d6 cold damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.

If the globe strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally water (not including water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches over an area 30 feet square. This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen water are trapped in the ice. A trapped creature can use an action to make a Strength check against your tek skill save DC to break free.

You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the tek skill, if you wish. A small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to the touch, appears in your hand. At any time, you or a creature you give the globe to can throw the globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it with a sling (to the sling’s normal range). It shatters on impact, with the same effect as the normal casting of the tek skill. You can also set the globe down without shattering it. After 1 minute, if the globe hasn’t already shattered, it explodes.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 6th.

### Tek Skills (G)

##### Gaseous Form

_3rd-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You transform a willing creature you touch, along with everything it’s wearing and carrying, into a misty cloud for the duration. The tek skill ends if the creature drops to 0 hit points. An incorporeal creature isn’t affected.

While in this form, the target’s only method of movement is a flying speed of 10 feet. The target can enter and occupy the space of another creature. The target has resistance to nontek damage, and it has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. The target can pass through small holes, nbullet openings, and even mere cracks, though it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces. The target can’t fall and remains hovering in the air even when stunned or otherwise incapacitated.

While in the form of a misty cloud, the target can’t talk or manipulate objects, and any objects it was carrying or holding can’t be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with. The target can’t attack or cast tek skills.

##### Gate

_9th-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem worth at least 500,000 credits)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You conjure a portal linking an unoccupied space you can see within range to a precise location on a different plane of existence. The portal is a circular opening, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in diameter. You can orient the portal in any direction you choose. The portal lasts for the duration.

The portal has a front and a back on each plane where it appears. Travel through the portal is possible only by moving through its front. Anything that does so is instantly transported to the other plane, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the portal.

Deities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created by this tek skill from opening in their presence or anywhere within their domains.

When you cast this tek skill, you can speak the name of a specific creature (a pseudonym, title, or nickname doesn’t work). If that creature is on a plane other than the one you are on, the portal opens in the named creature’s immediate vicinity and draws the creature through it to the nearest unoccupied space on your side of the portal. You gain no special power over the creature, and it is free to act as the GM deems appropriate. It might leave, attack you, or help you.

##### Geas

_5th-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V

**Duration:** 30 days

You place a tek command on a creature that you can see within range, forcing it to carry out some service or refrain from some action or course of activity as you decide. If the creature can understand you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. While the creature is charmed by you, it takes 5d10 psychic damage each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your instructions, but no more than once each day. A creature that can’t understand you is unaffected by the tek skill.

You can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would result in certain death. Should you issue a suicidal command, the tek skill ends.

You can end the tek skill early by using an action to dismiss it. A _remove hack_, _greater restoration_, or _wish_ tek skill also ends it.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 7th or 8th level, the duration is 1 year. When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 9th level, the tek skill lasts until it is ended by one of the tek skills mentioned above.

##### Gentle Repose

_2nd-level necromancy (ritual)_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 10 days

You touch a corpse or other remains. For the duration, the target is protected from decay and can’t become undead.

The tek skill also effectively extends the time limit on raising the target from the dead, since days spent under the influence of this tek skill don’t count against the time limit of tek skills such as _raise dead_.

##### Giant Insect

_4th-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You transform up to ten centipedes, three spiders, five wasps, or one scorpion within range into giant versions of their natural forms for the duration. A centipede becomes a giant centipede, a spider becomes a giant spider, a wasp becomes a giant wasp, and a scorpion becomes a giant scorpion.

Each creature obeys your verbal commands, and in combat, they act on your turn each round. The GM has the statistics for these creatures and resolves their actions and movement.

A creature remains in its giant size for the duration, until it drops to 0 hit points, or until you use an action to dismiss the effect on it.

The GM might allow you to choose different targets. For example, if you transform a bee, its giant version might have the same statistics as a giant wasp.

##### Glibness

_8th-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V

**Duration:** 1 hour

Until the tek skill ends, when you make a Charisma check, you can replace the number you roll with a 15. Additionally, no matter what you say, tek that would determine if you are telling the truth indicates that you are being truthful.

##### Globe of Invulnerability

_6th-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self (10-foot radius)

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

An immobile, faintly shimmering barrier springs into existence in a 10-foot radius around you and remains for the duration.

Any tek skill of 5th level or lower cast from outside the barrier can’t affect creatures or objects within it, even if the tek skill is cast using a higher level tek skill slot. Such a tek skill can target creatures and objects within the barrier, but the tek skill has no effect on them. Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected by such tek skills.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 7th level or higher, the barrier blocks tek skills of one level higher for each slot level above 6th.

##### Glyph of Warding

_3rd-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 hour

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem worth at least 20000 credits, which the tek skill consumes)

**Duration:** Until ditek skilled or triggered

When you cast this tek skill, you inscribe a glyph that harms other creatures, either upon a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a loot chest) to conceal the glyph. If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this tek skill, the glyph is broken, and the tek skill ends without being triggered.

The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tek skill save DC to be found.

You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the tek skill. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this tek skill ends.

You can further refine the trigger so the tek skill activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.

When you inscribe the glyph, choose _explosive runes_ or a _tek skill glyph_.

**_Explosive Runes._** When triggered, the glyph erupts with tek energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or concussive damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.

**_Tek Glyph._** You can store a prepared tek skill of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The tek skill must target a single creature or an area. The tek skill being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored tek skill is cast. If the tek skill has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the tek skill affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the tek skill summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the tek skill requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an _explosive runes_ glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a _tek skill glyph_, you can store any tek skill of up to the same level as the slot you use for the _glyph of warding_.

##### Grease

_1st-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 minute

Slick grease covers the ground in a 10-foot square centered on a point within range and turns it into difficult terrain for the duration.

When the grease appears, each creature standing in its area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.

##### Greater Invisibility

_4th-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You or a creature you touch becomes invisible until the tek skill ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target’s person.

##### Greater Restoration

_5th-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (gem worth at least 10000 credits, which the tek skill consumes)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You imbue a creature you touch with positive energy to undo a debilitating effect. You can reduce the target’s exhaustion level by one, or end one of the following effects on the target:

* One effect that charmed or petrified the target
* One hack, including the target’s attunement to a hacked alien artifact
* Any reduction to one of the target’s ability scores
* One effect reducing the target’s hit point maximum

##### Guards and Wards

_6th-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem worth at least 1000 credits)

**Duration:** 24 hours

You create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet of floor space (an area 50 feet square, or one hundred 5-foot squares or twenty-five 10-foot squares). The warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while you are casting the tek skill.

When you cast this tek skill, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects.

*Guards and wards* creates the following effects within the warded area.

**_Corridors._** Fog fills all the warded corridors, making them heavily obscured. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from the one it chooses.

**_Doors._** All doors in the warded area are locked, as if sealed by an _arcane lock_ tek skill. In addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an illusion (equivalent to the illusory object function of the _minor illusion_ tek skill) to make them appear as plain sections of wall.

**_Stairs._** Webs fill all stairs in the warded area from top to bottom, as the _web_ tek skill. These strands regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while _guards and wards_ lasts.

**_Other Tek Effect._** You can place your choice of one of the following tek effects within the warded area of the stronghold.
* Place _dancing lights_ in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that the lights repeat as long as _guards and wards_ lasts.
* Place _tek mouth_ in two locations.
* Place _stinking cloud_ in two locations. The vapors appear in the places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while _guards and wards_ lasts.
* Place a constant _gust of wind_ in one corridor or room.
* Place a _suggestion_ in one location. You select an area of up to 5 feet square, and any creature that enters or passes through the area receives the suggestion mentally.

The whole warded area radiates tek. A _dispel tek_ cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect.

You can create a permanently guarded and warded structure by casting this tek skill there every day for one year.

##### Guidance

_Divination cantrip_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You touch one willing creature. Once before the tek skill ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to one ability check of its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the ability check. The tek skill then ends.

##### Guiding Bolt

_1st-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 round

A flash of light streaks toward a creature of your choice within range. Make a ranged tek skill attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d6 radiant damage, and the next attack roll made against this target before the end of your next turn has advantage, thanks to the mystical dim light glittering on the target until then.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

##### Gust of Wind

_2nd-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self (60-foot line)

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A line of strong wind 60 feet long and 10 feet wide blasts from you in a direction you choose for the tek skill’s duration. Each creature that starts its turn in the line must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you in a direction following the line.

Any creature in the line must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving closer to you.

The gust disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames in the area. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50 percent chance to extinguish them.

As a bonus action on each of your turns before the tek skill ends, you can change the direction in which the line blasts from you.

### Tek Skills (H)

##### Hallow

_5th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 24 hours

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem worth at least 100,000 credits, which the tek skill consumes)

**Duration:** Until ditek skilled

You touch a point and infuse an area around it with holy (or unholy) power. The area can have a radius up to 60 feet, and the tek skill fails if the radius includes an area already under the effect a _hallow_ tek skill. The affected area is subject to the following effects.

First, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead can’t enter the area, nor can such creatures charm, frighten, or possess creatures within it. Any creature charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed upon entering the area. You can exclude one or more of those types of creatures from this effect.

Second, you can bind an extra effect to the area. Choose the effect from the following list, or choose an effect offered by the GM. Some of these effects apply to creatures in the area; you can designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures that follow a specific deity or leader, or creatures of a specific sort, such as orcs or trolls. When a creature that would be affected enters the tek skill’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it can make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature ignores the extra effect until it leaves the area.

**_Courage._** Affected creatures can’t be frightened while in the area.

**_Darkness._** Darkness fills the area. Normal light, as well as tek light created by tek skills of a lower level than the slot you used to cast this tek skill, can’t illuminate the area.

**_Daylight._** Bright light fills the area. Tek darkness created by tek skills of a lower level than the slot you used to cast this tek skill can’t extinguish the light.

**_Energy Protection._** Affected creatures in the area have resistance to one damage type of your choice, except for bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.

**_Energy Vulnerability._** Affected creatures in the area have vulnerability to one damage type of your choice, except for bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.

**_Everlasting Rest._** Dead bodies interred in the area can’t be turned into undead.

**_Extradimensional Interference._** Affected creatures can’t move or travel using teleportation or by extradimensional or interplanar means.

**_Fear._** Affected creatures are frightened while in the area.

**_Silence._** No sound can emanate from within the area, and no sound can reach into it.

**_Tongues._** Affected creatures can communicate with any other creature in the area, even if they don’t share a common language.

##### Hallucinatory Terrain

_4th-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes

**Range:** 300 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 24 hours

You make natural terrain in a 150-foot cube in range look, sound, and smell like some other sort of natural terrain. Thus, open fields or a road can be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the area aren’t changed in appearance.

The tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures entering the area are likely to see through the illusion. If the difference isn’t obvious by touch, a creature carefully examining the illusion can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tek skill save DC to disbelieve it. A creature who discerns the illusion for what it is, sees it as a vague image superimposed on the terrain.

##### Harm

_6th-level necromancy_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You unleash a virulent disease on a creature that you can see within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 14d6 radiation damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. The damage can’t reduce the target’s hit points below 1. If the target fails the saving throw, its hit point maximum is reduced for 1 hour by an amount equal to the radiation damage it took. Any effect that removes a disease allows a creature’s hit point maximum to return to normal before that time passes.

##### Haste

_3rd-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose a willing creature that you can see within range. Until the tek skill ends, the target’s speed is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to AC, it has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action.

When the tek skill ends, the target can’t move or take actions until after its next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over it.

##### Heal

_6th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Choose a creature that you can see within range. A surge of positive energy washes through the creature, causing it to regain 70 hit points. This tek skill also ends blindness, deafness, and any diseases affecting the target. This tek skill has no effect on constructs or undead.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 7th level or higher, the amount of healing increases by 10 for each slot level above 6th.

##### Healing Word

_1st-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A creature of your choice that you can see within range regains hit points equal to 1d4 + your Tekcasting ability modifier. This tek skill has no effect on undead or constructs.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 2nd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 1st.

##### Heat Metal

_2nd-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose a manufactured metal object, such as a metal weapon or a suit of heavy or medium metal armor, that you can see within range. You cause the object to glow red-hot. Any creature in physical contact with the object takes 2d8 fire damage when you cast the tek skill. Until the tek skill ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns to cause this damage again.

If a creature is holding or wearing the object and takes the damage from it, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or drop the object if it can. If it doesn’t drop the object, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of your next turn.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

##### Heroes’ Feast

_6th-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S , M (a gem worth at least 100,000 credits, which the tek skill consumes)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You bring forth a great feast, including magnificent food and drink. The feast takes 1 hour to consume and disappears at the end of that time, and the beneficial effects don’t set in until this hour is over. Up to twelve other creatures can partake of the feast.

A creature that partakes of the feast gains several benefits. The creature is cured of all diseases and poison, becomes immune to poison and being frightened, and makes all Wisdom saving throws with advantage. Its hit point maximum also increases by 2d10, and it gains the same number of hit points. These benefits last for 24 hours.

##### Heroism

_1st-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A willing creature you touch is imbued with bravery. Until the tek skill ends, the creature is immune to being frightened and gains temporary hit points equal to your Tekcasting ability modifier at the start of each of its turns. When the tek skill ends, the target loses any remaining temporary hit points from this tek skill.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.

##### Hideous Laughter

_1st-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A creature of your choice that you can see within range perceives everything as hilariously funny and falls into fits of laughter if this tek skill affects it. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or fall prone, becoming incapacitated and unable to stand up for the duration. A creature with an Intelligence score of 4 or less isn’t affected.

At the end of each of its turns, and each time it takes damage, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. The target has advantage on the saving throw if it’s triggered by damage. On a success, the tek skill ends.

##### Hold Monster

_5th-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 90 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be paralyzed for the duration. This tek skill has no effect on undead. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the tek skill ends on the target.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 6th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 5th. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

##### Hold Person

_2nd-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose a humanoid that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be paralyzed for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the tek skill ends on the target.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional humanoid for each slot level above 2nd. The humanoids must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

##### Holy Aura

_8th-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem worth at least 100,000 credits)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Divine light washes out from you and coalesces in a soft radiance in a 30-foot radius around you. Creatures of your choice in that radius when you cast this tek skill shed dim light in a 5-foot radius and have advantage on all saving throws, and other creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against them until the tek skill ends. In addition, when a fiend or an undead hits an affected creature with a melee attack, the aura flashes with brilliant light. The attacker must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the tek skill ends.

##### Hypnotic Pattern

_3rd-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a twisting pattern of colors that weaves through the air inside a 30-foot cube within range. The pattern appears for a moment and vanishes. Each creature in the area who sees the pattern must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes charmed for the duration. While charmed by this tek skill, the creature is incapacitated and has a speed of 0.

The tek skill ends for an affected creature if it takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor.

### Tek Skills (I)

##### Ice Storm

_4th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 300 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A hail of rock-hard ice pounds to the ground in a 20* foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Each creature in the cylinder must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and 4d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Hailstones turn the storm’s area of effect into difficult terrain until the end of your next turn.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 5th level or higher, the bludgeoning damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.

##### Identify

_1st-level divination (ritual)_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem worth at least 10,000 credits)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You choose one object that you must touch throughout the casting of the tek skill. If it is a alien artifact or some other tek-imbued object, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires attunement to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any tek skills are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a tek skill, you learn which tek skill created it.

If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn what tek skills, if any, are currently affecting it.

##### Illusory Script

_1st-level illusion (ritual)_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** S, M (a gem worth at least 1000 credits, which the tek skill consumes)

**Duration:** 10 days

You write on parchment, paper, or some other suitable writing material and imbue it with a potent illusion that lasts for the duration.

To you and any creatures you designate when you cast the tek skill, the writing appears normal, written in your hand, and conveys whatever meaning you intended when you wrote the text. To all others, the writing appears as if it were written in an unknown or tek script that is unintelligible. Alternatively, you can cause the writing to appear to be an entirely different message, written in a different hand and language, though the language must be one you know.

Should the tek skill be ditek skilled, the original script and the illusion both disappear.

A creature with truesight can read the hidden message.

##### Imprisonment

_9th-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem worth at least 5,000 credits)

**Duration:** Until ditek skilled

You create a tek restraint to hold a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be bound by the tek skill; if it succeeds, it is immune to this tek skill if you cast it again. While affected by this tek skill, the creature doesn’t need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn’t age. Divination tek skills can’t locate or perceive the target.

When you cast the tek skill, you choose one of the following forms of imprisonment.

**_Burial._** The target is entombed far beneath the earth in a sphere of tek force that is just large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass through the sphere, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to get into or out of it.

The special component for this version of the tek skill is a small mithral orb.

**_Chaining._** Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the target in place. The target is restrained until the tek skill ends, and it can’t move or be moved by any means until then.

The special component for this version of the tek skill is a fine chain of precious metal.

**_Hedged Prison._** The tek skill transports the target into a tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice.

The special component for this version of the tek skill is a miniature representation of the prison made from jade.

**_Minimus Containment._** The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone can’t be cut or broken while the tek skill remains in effect.

The special component for this version of the tek skill is a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.

**_Slumber._** The target falls asleep and can’t be awoken. The special component for this version of the tek skill consists of rare soporific herbs.

**_Ending the Tek._** During the casting of the tek skill, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the tek skill to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the GM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature’s name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or hit points.

A _dispel tek_ tek skill can end the tek skill only if it is cast as a 9th-level tek skill, targeting either the prison or the special component used to create it.

You can use a particular special component to create only one prison at a time. If you cast the tek skill again using the same component, the target of the first casting is immediately freed from its binding.

##### Incendiary Cloud

_8th-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 150 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A swirling cloud of smoke shot through with white* hot embers appears in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range. The cloud spreads around corners and is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

When the cloud appears, each creature in it must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 10d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the tek skill’s area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

The cloud moves 10 feet directly away from you in a direction that you choose at the start of each of your turns.

##### Inflict Wounds

_1st-level necromancy_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Make a melee tek skill attack against a creature you can reach. On a hit, the target takes 3d10 radiation damage.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 1st.

##### Insect Plague

_5th-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 300 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Swarming, biting locusts fill a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere spreads around corners. The sphere remains for the duration, and its area is lightly obscured. The sphere’s area is difficult terrain.

When the area appears, each creature in it must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 4d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the tek skill’s area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 5th.

##### Instant Summons

_6th-level conjuration (ritual)_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem worth 100,000 credits)

**Duration:** Until ditek skilled

You touch an object weighing 10 pounds or less whose longest dimension is 6 feet or less. The tek skill leaves an invisible mark on its surface and invisibly inscribes the name of the item on the sapphire you use as the material component. Each time you cast this tek skill, you must use a different sapphire.

At any time thereafter, you can use your action to speak the item’s name and crush the sapphire. The item instantly appears in your hand regardless of physical or planar distances, and the tek skill ends.

If another creature is holding or carrying the item, crushing the sapphire doesn’t transport the item to you, but instead you learn who the creature possessing the object is and roughly where that creature is located at that moment.

*Dispel tek* or a similar effect successfully applied to the sapphire ends this tek skill’s effect.

##### Invisibility

_2nd-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

A creature you touch becomes invisible until the tek skill ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target’s person. The tek skill ends for a target that attacks or casts a tek skill.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.

##### Irresistible Dance

_6th-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose one creature that you can see within range. The target begins a comic dance in place: shuffling, tapping its feet, and capering for the duration. Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this tek skill.

A dancing creature must use all its movement to dance without leaving its space and has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and attack rolls. While the target is affected by this tek skill, other creatures have advantage on attack rolls against it. As an action, a dancing creature makes a Wisdom saving throw to regain control of itself. On a successful save, the tek skill ends.

### Tek Skills (J)

##### Jump

_1st-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 minute

You touch a creature. The creature’s jump distance is tripled until the tek skill ends.

### Tek Skills (K)

##### Knock

_2nd-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Choose an object that you can see within range. The object can be a door, a box, a chest, a set of manacles, a padlock, or another object that contains a mundane or tek means that prevents access.

A target that is held shut by a mundane lock or that is stuck or barred becomes unlocked, unstuck, or unbarred. If the object has multiple locks, only one of them is unlocked.

If you choose a target that is held shut with _arcane lock_, that tek skill is suppressed for 10 minutes, during which time the target can be opened and shut normally.

When you cast the tek skill, a loud knock, audible from as far away as 300 feet, emanates from the target object.

### Tek Skills (L)

##### Legend Lore

_5th-level divination_

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem worth at least 45000 credits, which the tek skill consumes)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Name or describe a person, place, or object. The tek skill brings to your mind a brief summary of the significant lore about the thing you named. The lore might consist of current tales, forgotten stories, or even secret lore that has never been widely known. If the thing you named isn’t of legendary importance, you gain no information. The more information you already have about the thing, the more precise and detailed the information you receive is.

The information you learn is accurate but might be couched in figurative language. For example, if you have a mysterious tek axe on hand, the tek skill might yield this information: “Woe to the evildoer whose hand touches the axe, for even the haft slices the hand of the evil ones. Only a true Child of Stone, lover and beloved of Moradin, may awaken the true powers of the axe, and only with the sacred word _Rudnogg_ on the lips.”

##### Lesser Restoration

_2nd-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You touch a creature and can end either one disease or one condition afflicting it. The condition can be blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned.

##### Levitate

_2nd-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

One creature or object of your choice that you can see within range rises vertically, up to 20 feet, and remains suspended there for the duration. The tek skill can levitate a target that weighs up to 500 pounds. An unwilling creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw is unaffected.

The target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. You can change the target’s altitude by up to 20 feet in either direction on your turn. If you are the target, you can move up or down as part of your move. Otherwise, you can use your action to move the target, which must remain within the tek skill’s range.

When the tek skill ends, the target floats gently to the ground if it is still aloft.

##### Light

_Evocation cantrip_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V

**Duration:** 1 hour

You touch one object that is no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. Until the tek skill ends, the object sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you like. Completely covering the object with something opaque blocks the light. The tek skill ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as an action.

If you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the tek skill.

##### Shock Bolt

_3rd-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self (100-foot line)

**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fur and a rod of amber, crystal, or glass)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A stroke of lightning forming a line 100 feet long and 5 feet wide blasts out from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The lightning ignites flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

##### Locate Animals or Plants

_2nd-level divination (ritual)_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Describe or name a specific kind of beast or plant. Concentrating on the voice of nature in your surroundings, you learn the direction and distance to the closest creature or plant of that kind within 5 miles, if any are present.

##### Locate Creature

_4th-level divination_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

Describe or name a creature that is familiar to you. You sense the direction to the creature’s location, as long as that creature is within 1,000 feet of you. If the creature is moving, you know the direction of its movement.

The tek skill can locate a specific creature known to you, or the nearest creature of a specific kind (such as a human or a unicorn), so long as you have seen such a creature up close—within 30 feet—at least once. If the creature you described or named is in a different form, such as being under the effects of a _polymorph_ tek skill, this tek skill doesn’t locate the creature.

This tek skill can’t locate a creature if running water at least 10 feet wide blocks a direct path between you and the creature.

##### Locate Object

_2nd-level divination_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Describe or name an object that is familiar to you. You sense the direction to the object’s location, as long as that object is within 1,000 feet of you. If the object is in motion, you know the direction of its movement.

The tek skill can locate a specific object known to you, as long as you have seen it up close—within 30 feet—at least once. Alternatively, the tek skill can locate the nearest object of a particular kind, such as a certain kind of apparel, jewelry, furniture, tool, or weapon.

This tek skill can’t locate an object if any thickness of lead, even a thin sheet, blocks a direct path between you and the object.

##### Longstrider

_1st-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 hour

You touch a creature. The target’s speed increases by 10 feet until the tek skill ends.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.

### Tek Skills (M)

##### Mage Armor

_1st-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 8 hours

You touch a willing creature who isn’t wearing armor, and a protective tek force surrounds it until the tek skill ends. The target’s base AC becomes 13 + its Dexterity modifier. The tek skill ends if the target dons armor or if you dismiss the tek skill as an action.

##### Mage Hand

_Conjuration cantrip_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 minute

A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range. The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this tek skill again.

You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it.

The hand can’t attack, activate alien artifacts, or carry more than 10 pounds.

##### Tek Circle

_3rd-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** 10 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem worth at least 10000 credits, which the tek skill consumes)

**Duration:** 1 hour

You create a 10-foot-radius, 20-foot-tall cylinder of tek energy centered on a point on the ground that you can see within range. Glowing runes appear wherever the cylinder intersects with the floor or other surface.

Choose one or more of the following types of creatures: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. The circle affects a creature of the chosen type in the following ways:

* The creature can’t willingly enter the cylinder by nontek means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw.
* The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets within the cylinder.
* Targets within the cylinder can’t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by the creature.

When you cast this tek skill, you can elect to cause its tek to operate in the reverse direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from leaving the cylinder and protecting targets outside it.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 4th level or higher, the duration increases by 1 hour for each slot level above 3rd.

##### Tek Jar

_6th-level necromancy_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem worth at least 50000 credits)

**Duration:** Until ditek skilled

Your body falls into a catatonic state as your soul leaves it and enters the container you used for the tek skill’s material component. While your soul inhabits the container, you are aware of your surroundings as if you were in the container’s space. You can’t move or use reactions. The only action you can take is to project your soul up to 100 feet out of the container, either returning to your living body (and ending the tek skill) or attempting to possess a humanoids body.

You can attempt to possess any humanoid within 100 feet of you that you can see (creatures warded by a _protection from evil and good_ or _tek circle_ tek skill can’t be possessed). The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, your soul moves into the target’s body, and the target’s soul becomes trapped in the container. On a success, the target resists your efforts to possess it, and you can’t attempt to possess it again for 24 hours.

Once you possess a creature’s body, you control it. Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the creature, though you retain your alignment and your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You retain the benefit of your own class features. If the target has any class levels, you can’t use any of its class features.

Meanwhile, the possessed creature’s soul can perceive from the container using its own senses, but it can’t move or take actions at all.

While possessing a body, you can use your action to return from the host body to the container if it is within 100 feet of you, returning the host creature’s soul to its body. If the host body dies while you’re in it, the creature dies, and you must make a Charisma saving throw against your own Tekcasting DC. On a success, you return to the container if it is within 100 feet of you. Otherwise, you die.

If the container is destroyed or the tek skill ends, your soul immediately returns to your body. If your body is more than 100 feet away from you or if your body is dead when you attempt to return to it, you die. If another creature’s soul is in the container when it is destroyed, the creature’s soul returns to its body if the body is alive and within 100 feet. Otherwise, that creature dies.

When the tek skill ends, the container is destroyed.

##### Tek Missile

_1st-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You create three glowing darts of tek force. Each dart hits a creature of your choice that you can see within range. A dart deals 1d4 + 1 force damage to its target. The darts all strike simultaneously, and you can direct them to hit one creature or several.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 2nd level or higher, the tek skill creates one more dart for each slot level above 1st.

##### Tek Mouth

_2nd-level illusion (ritual)_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem worth at least 1000 credits, which the tek skill consumes)

**Duration:** Until ditek skilled

You implant a message within an object in range, a message that is uttered when a trigger condition is met. Choose an object that you can see and that isn’t being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the message, which must be 25 words or less, though it can be delivered over as long as 10 minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that will trigger the tek skill to deliver your message.

When that circumstance occurs, a tek mouth appears on the object and recites the message in your voice and at the same volume you spoke. If the object you chose has a mouth or something that looks like a mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue), the tek mouth appears there so that the words appear to come from the object’s mouth. When you cast this tek skill, you can have the tek skill end after it delivers its message, or it can remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs.

The triggering circumstance can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object. For example, you could instruct the mouth to speak when any creature moves within 30 feet of the object or when a silver bell rings within 30 feet of it.

##### Tek Weapon

_2nd-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You touch a nontek weapon. Until the tek skill ends, that weapon becomes a tek weapon with a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 4th level or higher, the bonus increases to +2. When you use a tek skill slot of 6th level or higher, the bonus increases to +3.

##### Magnificent Mansion

_7th-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** 300 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem worth at least 500 credits)

**Duration:** 24 hours

You conjure an extradimensional dwelling in range that lasts for the duration. You choose where its one entrance is located. The entrance shimmers faintly and is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall. You and any creature you designate when you cast the tek skill can enter the extradimensional dwelling as long as the portal remains open. You can open or close the portal if you are within 30 feet of it. While closed, the portal is invisible.

Beyond the portal is a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.

You can create any floor plan you like, but the space can’t exceed 50 cubes, each cube being 10 feet on each side. The place is furnished and decorated as you choose. It contains sufficient food to serve a nine-course banquet for up to 100 people. A staff of 100 near-transparent servants attends all who enter. You decide the visual appearance of these servants and their attire. They are completely obedient to your orders. Each servant can perform any task a normal human servant could perform, but they can’t attack or take any action that would directly harm another creature. Thus the servants can fetch things, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve food, pour wine, and so on. The servants can go anywhere in the mansion but can’t leave it. Furnishings and other objects created by this tek skill dissipate into smoke if removed from the mansion. When the tek skill ends, any creatures inside the extradimensional space are expelled into the open spaces nearest to the entrance.

##### Major Image

_3rd-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You can’t create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal concussive damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte’s stench).

As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tek skill save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 6th level or higher, the tek skill lasts until ditek skilled, without requiring your concentration.

##### Mass Cure Wounds

_5th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A wave of healing energy washes out from a point of your choice within range. Choose up to six creatures in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each target regains hit points equal to 3d8 + your Tekcasting ability modifier. This tek skill has no effect on undead or constructs.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 6th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.

##### Mass Heal

_9th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A flood of healing energy flows from you into injured creatures around you. You restore up to 700 hit points, divided as you choose among any number of creatures that you can see within range. Creatures healed by this tek skill are also cured of all diseases and any effect making them blinded or deafened. This tek skill has no effect on undead or constructs.

##### Mass Healing Word

_3rd-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Instantaneous

As you call out words of restoration, up to six creatures of your choice that you can see within range regain hit points equal to 1d4 + your Tekcasting ability modifier. This tek skill has no effect on undead or constructs.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 4th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 3rd.

##### Mass Suggestion

_6th-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V

**Duration:** 24 hours

You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and influence up to twelve creatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the tek skill.

Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the tek skill ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.

You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a group of soldiers give all their money to the first beggar they meet. If the condition isn’t met before the tek skill ends, the activity isn’t performed.

If you or any of your companions damage a creature affected by this tek skill, the tek skill ends for that creature.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a 7th-level tek skill slot, the duration is 10 days. When you use an 8th-level tek skill slot, the duration is 30 days. When you use a 9th-level tek skill slot, the duration is a year and a day.

##### Maze

_8th-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You banish a creature that you can see within range into a labyrinthine demiplane. The target remains there for the duration or until it escapes the maze.

The target can use its action to attempt to escape. When it does so, it makes a DC 20 Intelligence check. If it succeeds, it escapes, and the tek skill ends (a minotaur or goristro demon automatically succeeds).

When the tek skill ends, the target reappears in the space it left or, if that space is occupied, in the nearest unoccupied space.

##### Meld into Stone

_3rd-level transmutation (ritual)_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 8 hours

You step into a stone object or surface large enough to fully contain your body, melding yourself and all the equipment you carry with the stone for the duration. Using your movement, you step into the stone at a point you can touch. Nothing of your presence remains visible or otherwise detectable by nontek senses.

While merged with the stone, you can’t see what occurs outside it, and any Wisdom (Perception) checks you make to hear sounds outside it are made with disadvantage. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast tek skills on yourself while merged in the stone. You can use your movement to leave the stone where you entered it, which ends the tek skill. You otherwise can’t move.

Minor physical damage to the stone doesn’t harm you, but its partial destruction or a change in its shape (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals 6d6 bludgeoning damage to you. The stone’s complete destruction (or transmutation into a different substance) expels you and deals 50 bludgeoning damage to you. If expelled, you fall prone in an unoccupied space closest to where you first entered.

##### Mending

_Transmutation cantrip_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

This tek skill repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.

This tek skill can physically repair a alien artifact or construct, but the tek skill can’t restore tek to such an object.

##### Message

*Transmutation cantrip_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 round

You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.

You can cast this tek skill through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Tek silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the tek skill. The tek skill doesn’t have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.

##### Meteor Swarm

_9th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 1 mile

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Blazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four different points you can see within range. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius sphere centered on each point you choose must make a Dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads around corners. A creature takes 20d6 fire damage and 20d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one fiery burst is affected only once.

The tek skill damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried.

##### Mind Blank

_8th-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 24 hours

Until the tek skill ends, one willing creature you touch is immune to psychic damage, any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, divination tek skills, and the charmed condition. The tek skill even foils _wish_ tek skills and tek skills or effects of similar power used to affect the target’s mind or to gain information about the target.

##### Minor Illusion

_Illusion cantrip_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** S

**Duration:** 1 minute

You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this tek skill again.

If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else’s voice, a lion’s roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the tek skill ends.

If you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can’t create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.

If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tek skill save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.

##### Mirage Arcane

_7th-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes

**Range:** Sight

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 10 days

You make terrain in an area up to 1 mile square look, sound, smell, and even feel like some other sort of terrain. The terrain’s general shape remains the same, however. Open fields or a road could be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road.

Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures, or add them where none are present. The tek skill doesn’t disguise, conceal, or add creatures.

The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground into difficult terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise impede movement through the area. Any piece of the illusory terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the tek skill’s area disappears immediately.

Creatures with truesight can see through the illusion to the terrain’s true form; however, all other elements of the illusion remain, so while the creature is aware of the illusion’s presence, the creature can still physically interact with the illusion.

##### Mirror Image

_2nd-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 minute

Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the tek skill ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it’s impossible to track which image is real. You can use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.

Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the tek skill’s duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates.

If you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to change the attack’s target to a duplicate. With two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With one duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.

A duplicate’s AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The tek skill ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.

A creature is unaffected by this tek skill if it can’t see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight.

##### Mislead

_5th-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You become invisible at the same time that an illusory double of you appears where you are standing. The double lasts for the duration, but the invisibility ends if you attack or cast a tek skill.

You can use your action to move your illusory double up to twice your speed and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose.

You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were located where it is. On each of your turns as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.

##### Misty Step

_2nd-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Briefly surrounded by silvery mist, you teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see.

##### Modify Memory

_5th-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to reshape another creature’s memories. One creature that you can see must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting the creature, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes charmed by you for the duration. The charmed target is incapacitated and unaware of its surroundings, though it can still hear you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another tek skill, this tek skill ends, and none of the target’s memories are modified.

While this charm lasts, you can affect the target’s memory of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting detail, change its memory of the details of the event, or create a memory of some other event.

You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the tek skill ends before you have finished describing the modified memories, the creature’s memory isn’t altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the tek skill ends.

A modified memory doesn’t necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature’s natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The GM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant manner.

A _remove hack_ or _greater restoration_ tek skill cast on the target restores the creature’s true memory.

**_At Higher Levels._** If you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 6th level or higher, you can alter the target’s memories of an event that took place up to 7 days ago (6th level), 30 days ago (7th level), 1 year ago (8th level), or any time in the creature’s past (9th level).

##### Moonbeam

_2nd-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot* radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the tek skill ends, dim light fills the cylinder.

When a creature enters the tek skill’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain, and it must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

A shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it also instantly reverts to its original form and can’t assume a different form until it leaves the tek skill’s light.

On each of your turns after you cast this tek skill, you can use an action to move the beam 60 feet in any direction.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.

##### Move Earth

_6th-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 2 hours

Choose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on a side within range. You can reshape dirt, sand, or clay in the area in any manner you choose for the duration. You can raise or lower the area’s elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes can’t exceed half the area’s largest dimension. So, if you affect a 40-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower the square’s elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these changes to complete.

At the end of every 10 minutes you spend concentrating on the tek skill, you can choose a new area of terrain to affect.

Because the terrain’s transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area can’t usually be trapped or injured by the ground’s movement.

This tek skill can’t manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks and structures shift to accommodate the new terrain. If the way you shape the terrain would make a structure unstable, it might collapse.

Similarly, this tek skill doesn’t directly affect plant growth. The moved earth carries any plants along with it.

### Tek Skills (N)

##### Nondetection

_3rd-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem worth 2500 credits, which the tek skill consumes)

**Duration:** 8 hours

For the duration, you hide a target that you touch from divination tek. The target can be a willing creature or a place or an object no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. The target can’t be targeted by any divination tek or perceived through tek scrying sensors.

### Tek Skills (O)

### Tek Skills (P)

##### Pass without Trace

_2nd-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

A veil of shadows and silence radiates from you, masking you and your companions from detection. For the duration, each creature you choose within 30 feet of you (including you) has a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks and can’t be tracked except by tek means. A creature that receives this bonus leaves behind no tracks or other traces of its passage.

##### Passwall

_5th-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 hour

A passage appears at a point of your choice that you can see on a wooden, plaster, or stone surface (such as a wall, a ceiling, or a floor) within range, and lasts for the duration. You choose the opening’s dimensions: up to 5 feet wide, 8 feet tall, and 20 feet deep. The passage creates no instability in a structure surrounding it.

When the opening disappears, any creatures or objects still in the passage created by the tek skill are safely ejected to an unoccupied space nearest to the surface on which you cast the tek skill.

##### Phantasmal Killer

_4th-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You tap into the nightmares of a creature you can see within range and create an illusory manifestation of its deepest fears, visible only to that creature. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes frightened for the duration. At the end of each of the target’s turns before the tek skill ends, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the tek skill ends.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 4th.

##### Phantom Steed

_3rd-level illusion (ritual)_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 hour

A Large quasi-real, horselike creature appears on the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice within range. You decide the creature’s appearance, but it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the equipment created by the tek skill vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away from the steed.

For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The creature uses the statistics for a riding horse, except it has a speed of 100 feet and can travel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast pace. When the tek skill ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount. The tek skill ends if you use an action to dismiss it or if the steed takes any damage.

##### Planar Ally

_6th-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You beseech an otherworldly entity for aid. The being must be known to you: a god, a primordial, a demon prince, or some other being of cosmic power. That entity sends a celestial, an elemental, or a fiend loyal to it to aid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied space within range. If you know a specific creature’s name, you can speak that name when you cast this tek skill to request that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (GM’s choice).

When the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave in any particular way. You can ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isn’t obliged to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services.

Payment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or alien artifacts to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of loot. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.

As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 10000 credits per minute. A task measured in hours requires 100,000 credits per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 1000,000 credits per day. The GM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the tek skill. If the task is aligned with the creature’s ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.

After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature’s service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane.

A creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it, receiving a full share of experience points awarded.

##### Planar Binding

_5th-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 hour

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem worth at least 100,000 credits, which the tek skill consumes)

**Duration:** 24 hours

With this tek skill, you attempt to bind a celestial, an elemental, a fey, or a fiend to your service. The creature must be within range for the entire casting of the tek skill. (Typically, the creature is first summoned into the center of an inverted _tek circle_ in order to keep it trapped while this tek skill is cast.) At the completion of the casting, the target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it is bound to serve you for the duration. If the creature was summoned or created by another tek skill, that tek skill’s duration is extended to match the duration of this tek skill.

A bound creature must follow your instructions to the best of its ability. You might command the creature to accompany you on an adventure, to guard a location, or to deliver a message. The creature obeys the letter of your instructions, but if the creature is hostile to you, it strives to twist your words to achieve its own objectives. If the creature carries out your instructions completely before the tek skill ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you are on the same plane of existence. If you are on a different plane of existence, it returns to the place where you bound it and remains there until the tek skill ends.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of a higher level, the duration increases to 10 days with a 6th-level slot, to 30 days with a 7th* level slot, to 180 days with an 8th-level slot, and to a year and a day with a 9th-level tek skill slot.

##### Plane Shift

_7th-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem worth at least 25000 credits)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle are transported to a different plane of existence. You can specify a target destination in general terms, such as the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire or the palace of Dispater on the second level of the Nine Hells, and you appear in or near that destination. If you are trying to reach the City of Brass, for example, you might arrive in its Street of Steel, before its Gate of Ashes, or looking at the city from across the Sea of Fire, at the GM’s discretion.

Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle on another plane of existence, this tek skill can take you to that circle. If the teleportation circle is too small to hold all the creatures you transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied spaces next to the circle.

You can use this tek skill to banish an unwilling creature to another plane. Choose a creature within your reach and make a melee tek skill attack against it. On a hit, the creature must make a Charisma saving throw. If the creature fails this save, it is transported to a random location on the plane of existence you specify. A creature so transported must find its own way back to your current plane of existence.

##### Plant Growth

_3rd-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action or 8 hours

**Range:** 150 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

This tek skill channels vitality into plants within a specific area. There are two possible uses for the tek skill, granting either immediate or long-term benefits.

If you cast this tek skill using 1 action, choose a point within range. All normal plants in a 100-foot radius centered on that point become thick and overgrown. A creature moving through the area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.

You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the tek skill’s area from being affected.

If you cast this tek skill over 8 hours, you enrich the land. All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched for 1 year. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested.

##### Polymorph

_4th-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

This tek skill transforms a creature that you can see within range into a new form. An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. The tek skill has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points.

The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target’s (or the target’s level, if it doesn’t have a challenge rating). The target’s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality.

The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn’t knocked unconscious.

The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak, cast tek skills, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.

The target’s gear melds into the new form. The creature can’t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

##### Power Word Kill

_9th-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You utter a word of power that can compel one creature you can see within range to die instantly. If the creature you choose has 100 hit points or fewer, it dies. Otherwise, the tek skill has no effect.

##### Power Word Stun

_8th-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You speak a word of power that can overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see within range, leaving it dumbfounded. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it is stunned. Otherwise, the tek skill has no effect.

The stunned target must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, this stunning effect ends.

##### Prayer of Healing

_2nd-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Up to six creatures of your choice that you can see within range each regain hit points equal to 2d8 + your Tekcasting ability modifier. This tek skill has no effect on undead or constructs.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 3rd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

##### Prestidigitation

_Transmutation cantrip_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 10 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Up to 1 hour

This tek skill is a minor tek trick that novice tekcasters use for practice. You create one of the following tek effects within range:

* You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor.
* You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.
* You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.
* You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.
* You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour.
* You create a nontek trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.

If you cast this tek skill multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

##### Prismatic Spray

_7th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self (60-foot cone)

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Eight multicolored rays of light flash from your hand. Each ray is a different color and has a different power and purpose. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. For each target, roll a d8 to determine which color ray affects it.

1.  **_Red._** The target takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
2.  **_Orange._** The target takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
3.  **_Yellow._** The target takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
4.  **_Green._** The target takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
5.  **_Blue._** The target takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
6.  **_Indigo._** On a failed save, the target is restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the tek skill ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.
7.  **_Violet._** On a failed save, the target is blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of existence of the GM’s choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn’t its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.)
8.  **_Special._** The target is struck by two rays. Roll twice more, rerolling any 8.

##### Prismatic Wall

_9th-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 10 minutes

A shimmering, multicolored plane of light forms a vertical opaque wall—up to 90 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 inch thick—centered on a point you can see within range. Alternatively, you can shape the wall into a sphere up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point you choose within range. The wall remains in place for the duration. If you position the wall so that it passes through a space occupied by a creature, the tek skill fails, and your action and the tek skill slot are wasted.

The wall sheds bright light out to a range of 100 feet and dim light for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate at the time you cast the tek skill can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves to within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute.

The wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the wall’s layers. As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer’s properties as described below.

The wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the duration of the tek skill. A _rod of cancellation_ destroys a _prismatic wall_, but an _antitek field_ has no effect on it.

1.  **_Red._** The creature takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, nontek ranged attacks can’t pass through the wall. The layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it.
2.  **_Orange._** The creature takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, tek ranged attacks can’t pass through the wall. The layer is destroyed by a strong wind.
3.  **_Yellow._** The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 60 force damage to it.
4.  **_Green._** The creature takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A _passwall_ tek skill, or another tek skill of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this layer.
5.  **_Blue._** The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 fire damage to it.
6.  **_Indigo._** On a failed save, the creature is restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the tek skill ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind. While this layer is in place, tek skills can’t be cast through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a _daylight_ tek skill or a similar tek skill of equal or higher level.
7.  **_Violet._** On a failed save, the creature is blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of the GM’s choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn’t its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) This layer is destroyed by a _dispel tek_ tek skill or a similar tek skill of equal or higher level that can end tek skills and tek effects.

##### Private Sanctum

_4th-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 24 hours

You make an area within range secure. The area is a cube that can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side. The tek skill lasts for the duration or until you use an action to dismiss it.

When you cast the tek skill, you decide what sort of security the tek skill provides, choosing any or all of the following properties:

* Sound can’t pass through the barrier at the edge of the warded area.
* The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing vision (including darkvision) through it.
* Sensors created by divination tek skills can’t appear inside the protected area or pass through the barrier at its perimeter.
* Creatures in the area can’t be targeted by divination tek skills.
* Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area.
* Planar travel is blocked within the warded area. Casting this tek skill on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 5th level or higher, you can increase the size of the cube by 100 feet for each slot level beyond 4th. Thus you could protect a cube that can be up to 200 feet on one side by using a tek skill slot of 5th level.

##### Produce Flame

_Conjuration cantrip_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 10 minutes

A flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The tek skill ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again.

You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the tek skill. When you cast this tek skill, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged tek skill attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage.

This tek skill’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

##### Programmed Illusion

_6th-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem worth at least 2500 credits)

**Duration:** Until ditek skilled

You create an illusion of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon within range that activates when a specific condition occurs. The illusion is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a 30-foot cube, and you decide when you cast the tek skill how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes. This scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes.

When the condition you specify occurs, the illusion springs into existence and performs in the manner you described. Once the illusion finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes. After this time, the illusion can be activated again.

The triggering condition can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the area. For example, you could create an illusion of yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt to open a trapped door, or you could set the illusion to trigger only when a creature says the correct word or phrase.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tek skill save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.

##### Project Image

_7th-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 500 miles

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem worth at least 500 credits)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 day

You create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for the duration. The copy can appear at any location within range that you have seen before, regardless of intervening obstacles. The illusion looks and sounds like you but is intangible. If the illusion takes any damage, it disappears, and the tek skill ends.

You can use your action to move this illusion up to twice your speed, and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It mimics your mannerisms perfectly.

You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in its space. On your turn as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A

creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tek skill save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.

##### Protection from Energy

_3rd-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

For the duration, the willing creature you touch has resistance to one damage type of your choice: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or concussive.

##### Protection from Evil and Good

_1st-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration up to 10 minutes

Until the tek skill ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.

The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also can’t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by them. If the target is already charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.

##### Protection from Poison

_2nd-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 hour

You touch a creature. If it is poisoned, you neutralize the poison. If more than one poison afflicts the target, you neutralize one poison that you know is present, or you neutralize one at random.

For the duration, the target has advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and it has resistance to poison damage.

##### Purify Food and Drink

_1st-level transmutation (ritual)_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 10 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

All nontek food and drink within a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range is purified and rendered free of poison and disease.

### Tek Skills (Q)

### Tek Skills (R)

##### Raise Dead

_5th-level necromancy_

**Casting Time:** 1 hour

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem worth at least 50000 credits, which the tek skill consumes)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You return a dead creature you touch to life, provided that it has been dead no longer than 10 days. If the creature’s soul is both willing and at liberty to rejoin the body, the creature returns to life with 1 hit point.

This tek skill also neutralizes any poisons and cures nontek diseases that affected the creature at the time it died. This tek skill doesn’t, however, remove tek diseases, hacks, or similar effects; if these aren’t first removed prior to casting the tek skill, they take effect when the creature returns to life. The tek skill can’t return an undead creature to life.

This tek skill closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn’t restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its Nature—its head, for instance—the tek skill automatically fails.

Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a −4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.

##### Ray of Enfeeblement

_2nd-level necromancy_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A black beam of enervating energy springs from your finger toward a creature within range. Make a ranged tek skill attack against the target. On a hit, the target deals only half damage with weapon attacks that use Strength until the tek skill ends.

At the end of each of the target’s turns, it can make a Constitution saving throw against the tek skill. On a success, the tek skill ends.

##### Ray of Frost

_Evocation cantrip_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A frigid beam of blue-white light streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged tek skill attack against the target. On a hit, it takes 1d8 cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.

The tek skill’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

##### Regenerate

_7th-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 hour

You touch a creature and stimulate its natural healing ability. The target regains 4d8 + 15 hit points. For the duration of the tek skill, the target regains 1 hit point at the start of each of its turns (10 hit points each minute).

The target’s severed body members (fingers, legs, tails, and so on), if any, are restored after 2 minutes. If you have the severed part and hold it to the stump, the tek skill instantaneously causes the limb to knit to the stump.

##### Reincarnate

_5th-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 hour

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem worth at least 100,000 credits, which the tek skill consumes)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You touch a dead humanoid or a piece of a dead humanoid. Provided that the creature has been dead no longer than 10 days, the tek skill forms a new adult body for it and then calls the soul to enter that body.

If the target’s soul isn’t free or willing to do so, the tek skill fails.

The tek fashions a new body for the creature to inhabit, which likely causes the creature’s race to change. The GM rolls a d100 and consults the following table to determine what form the creature takes when restored to life, or the GM chooses a form.

| d100  | Race                |
|-------|---------------------|
| 01–04 | Dragonborn          |
| 05–13 | Dwarf, hill         |
| 14–21 | Dwarf, mountain     |
| 22–25 | Elf, dark           |
| 26–34 | Elf, high           |
| 35–42 | Elf, wood           |
| 43–46 | Gnome, forest       |
| 47–52 | Gnome, rock         |
| 53–56 | Half-elf            |
| 57–60 | Half-orc            |
| 61–68 | Halfling, lightfoot |
| 69–76 | Halfling, stout     |
| 77–96 | Human               |
| 97–00 | Tiefling            |

The reincarnated creature recalls its former life and experiences. It retains the capabilities it had in its original form, except it exchanges its original race for the new one and changes its racial traits accordingly.

##### Remove Hack

_3rd-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

At your touch, all hacks affecting one creature or object end. If the object is a hacked alien artifact, its hack remains, but the tek skill breaks its owner’s attunement to the object so it can be removed or discarded.

##### Resilient Sphere

_4th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A sphere of shimmering force encloses a creature or object of Large size or smaller within range. An unwilling creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is enclosed for the duration.

Nothing—not physical objects, energy, or other tek skill effects—can pass through the barrier, in or out, though a creature in the sphere can breathe there. The sphere is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside can’t be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the sphere damage anything outside it.

The sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature or object inside. An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere’s walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half the creature’s speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked up and moved by other creatures.

A _disintegrate_ tek skill targeting the globe destroys it without harming anything inside it.

##### Resistance

_Abjuration cantrip_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You touch one willing creature. Once before the tek skill ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to one saving throw of its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the saving throw. The tek skill then ends.

##### Resurrection

_7th-level necromancy_

**Casting Time:** 1 hour

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem worth at least 100,000 credits, which the tek skill consumes)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You touch a dead creature that has been dead for no more than a century, that didn’t die of old age, and that isn’t undead. If its soul is free and willing, the target returns to life with all its hit points.

This tek skill neutralizes any poisons and cures normal diseases afflicting the creature when it died. It doesn’t, however, remove tek diseases, hacks, and the like; if such effects aren’t removed prior to casting the tek skill, they afflict the target on its return to life.

This tek skill closes all mortal wounds and restores any missing body parts.

Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a −4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.

Casting this tek skill to restore life to a creature that has been dead for one year or longer taxes you greatly. Until you finish a long rest, you can’t cast tek skills again, and you have disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.

##### Reverse Gravity

_7th-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 100 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

This tek skill reverses gravity in a 50-foot-radius, 100* foot high cylinder centered on a point within range. All creatures and objects that aren’t somehow anchored to the ground in the area fall upward and reach the top of the area when you cast this tek skill. A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall.

If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it just as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, for the duration.

At the end of the duration, affected objects and creatures fall back down.

##### Revivify

_3rd-level necromancy_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem worth 30000 credits, which the tek skill consumes)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You touch a creature that has died within the last minute. That creature returns to life with 1 hit point. This tek skill can’t return to life a creature that has died of old age, nor can it restore any missing body parts.

##### Rope Trick

_2nd-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 hour

You touch a length of rope that is up to 60 feet long. One end of the rope then rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular to the ground. At the upper end of the rope, an invisible entrance opens to an extradimensional space that lasts until the tek skill ends.

The extradimensional space can be reached by climbing to the top of the rope. The space can hold as many as eight Medium or smaller creatures. The rope can be pulled into the space, making the rope disappear from view outside the space.

Attacks and tek skills can’t cross through the entrance into or out of the extradimensional space, but those inside can see out of it as if through a 3-foot-by-5* foot window centered on the rope.

Anything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the tek skill ends.

### Tek Skills (S)

##### Sacred Flame

_Evocation cantrip_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Flame-like radiance descends on a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 radiant damage. The target gains no benefit from cover for this saving throw.

The tek skill’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

##### Sanctuary

_1st-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 minute

You ward a creature within range against attack. Until the tek skill ends, any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful tek skill must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or tek skill. This tek skill doesn’t protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the explosion of a fireball.

If the warded creature makes an attack or casts a tek skill that affects an enemy creature, this tek skill ends.

##### Scorching Ray

_2nd-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You create three rays of fire and hurl them at targets within range. You can hurl them at one target or several.

Make a ranged tek skill attack for each ray. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 fire damage.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 3rd level or higher, you create one additional ray for each slot level above 2nd.

##### Scrying

_5th-level divination_

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem worth at least 100,000 credits)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You can see and hear a particular creature you choose that is on the same plane of existence as you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, which is modified by how well you know the target and the sort of physical connection you have to it. If a target knows you’re casting this tek skill, it can fail the saving throw voluntarily if it wants to be observed.

| Knowledge                                 | Save Modifier |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Secondhand (you have heard of the target) | +5            |
| Firsthand (you have met the target)       | +0            |
| Familiar (you know the target well)       | −5            |

| Connection                                        | Save Modifier |
|---------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Likeness or picture                               | −2            |
| Possession or garment                             | −4            |
| Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, or the like | −10           |

On a successful save, the target isn’t affected, and you can’t use this tek skill against it again for 24 hours.

On a failed save, the tek skill creates an invisible sensor within 10 feet of the target. You can see and hear through the sensor as if you were there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the duration. A creature that can see invisible objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of your fist.

Instead of targeting a creature, you can choose a location you have seen before as the target of this tek skill. When you do, the sensor appears at that location and doesn’t move.

##### Secret Chest

_4th-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem worth at least 500,000 credits)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You hide a chest, and all its contents, on the Ethereal Plane. You must touch the chest and the miniature replica that serves as a material component for the tek skill. The chest can contain up to 12 cubic feet of nonliving material (3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet).

While the chest remains on the Ethereal Plane, you can use an action and touch the replica to recall the chest. It appears in an unoccupied space on the ground within 5 feet of you. You can send the chest back to the Ethereal Plane by using an action and touching both the chest and the replica.

After 60 days, there is a cumulative 5 percent chance per day that the tek skill’s effect ends. This effect ends if you cast this tek skill again, if the smaller replica chest is destroyed, or if you choose to end the tek skill as an action. If the tek skill ends and the larger chest is on the Ethereal Plane, it is irretrievably lost.

##### See Invisibility

_2nd-level divination_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 hour

For the duration, you see invisible creatures and objects as if they were visible, and you can see into the Ethereal Plane. Ethereal creatures and objects appear ghostly and translucent.

##### Seeming

_5th-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 8 hours

This tek skill allows you to change the appearance of any number of creatures that you can see within range. You give each target you choose a new, illusory appearance. An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw, and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this tek skill.

The tek skill disguises physical appearance as well as clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change a target’s body type, so you must choose a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. The tek skill lasts for the duration, unless you use your action to dismiss it sooner.

The changes wrought by this tek skill fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this tek skill to add a hat to a creature’s outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel the creature’s head and hair. If you use this tek skill to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.

A creature can use its action to inspect a target and make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tek skill save DC. If it succeeds, it becomes aware that the target is disguised.

##### Sending

_3rd-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Unlimited

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 round

You send a short message of twenty-five words or less to a creature with which you are familiar. The creature hears the message in its mind, recognizes you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like manner immediately. The tek skill enables creatures with Intelligence scores of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your message.

You can send the message across any distance and even to other planes of existence, but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is a 5 percent chance that the message doesn’t arrive.

##### Sequester

_7th-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem worth at least 500,000 credits, which the tek skill consumes)

**Duration:** Until ditek skilled

By means of this tek skill, a willing creature or an object can be hidden away, safe from detection for the duration. When you cast the tek skill and touch the target, it becomes invisible and can’t be targeted by divination tek skills or perceived through scrying sensors created by divination tek skills.

If the target is a creature, it falls into a state of suspended animation. Time ceases to flow for it, and it doesn’t grow older.

You can set a condition for the tek skill to end early. The condition can be anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of the target. Examples include “after 1,000 years” or “when the tarrasque awakens.” This tek skill also ends if the target takes any damage.

##### Shapechange

_9th-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem worth at least 1,50000 credits)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You assume the form of a different creature for the duration. The new form can be of any creature with a challenge rating equal to your level or lower. The creature can’t be a construct or an undead, and you must have seen the sort of creature at least once. You transform into an average example of that creature, one without any class levels or the Tekcasting trait.

Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen creature, though you retain your alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus listed in its statistics is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus in place of yours. You can’t use any legendary actions or lair actions of the new form.

You assume the hit points and Hit Dice of the new form. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.

You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them, provided that your new form is physically capable of doing so. You can’t use any special senses you have (for example, darkvision) unless your new form also has that sense. You can only speak if the creature can normally speak.

When you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground, merges into the new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal. The GM determines whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change shape or size to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge into your new form. Equipment that merges has no effect in that state.

During this tek skill’s duration, you can use your action to assume a different form following the same restrictions and rules for the original form, with one exception: if your new form has more hit points than your current one, your hit points remain at their current value.

##### Shatter

_2nd-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 concussive damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.

A nontek object that isn’t being worn or carried also takes the damage if it’s in the tek skill’s area.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

##### Shield

_1st-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you are hit by an attack or targeted by the _tek missile_ tek skill

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 round

An invisible barrier of tek force appears and protects you. Until the start of your next turn, you have a +5 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack, and you take no damage from _tek missile_.

##### Shield of Faith

_1st-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

A shimmering field appears and surrounds a creature of your choice within range, granting it a +2 bonus to AC for the duration.

##### Shillelagh

_Transmutation cantrip_

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 minute

The wood of a club or Bowstaff you are holding is imbued with nature’s power. For the duration, you can use your Tekcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using that weapon, and the weapon’s damage die becomes a d8. The weapon also becomes tek, if it isn’t already. The tek skill ends if you cast it again or if you let go of the weapon.

##### Concussiveing Grasp

_Evocation cantrip_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Shock springs from your hand to deliver a concussive to a creature you try to touch. Make a melee tek skill attack against the target. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 lightning damage, and it can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn.

The tek skill’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

##### Silence

_2nd-level illusion (ritual)_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

For the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. Any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to concussive damage, and creatures are deafened while entirely inside it. Casting a tek skill that includes a verbal component is impossible there.

##### Silent Image

_1st-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 15-foot cube. The image appears at a spot within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual; it isn’t accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.

You can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tek skill save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image.

##### Simulacrum

_7th-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** 12 hours

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem worth at least 150,000 credits, which is consumed by the tek skill)

**Duration:** Until ditek skilled

You shape an illusory duplicate of one beast or humanoid that is within range for the entire casting time of the tek skill. The duplicate is a creature, partially real and formed from ice or snow, and it can take actions and otherwise be affected as a normal creature. It appears to be the same as the original, but it has half the creature’s hit point maximum and is formed without any equipment. Otherwise, the illusion uses all the statistics of the creature it duplicates.

The simulacrum is friendly to you and creatures you designate. It obeys your spoken commands, moving and acting in accordance with your wishes and acting on your turn in combat. The simulacrum lacks the ability to learn or become more powerful, so it never increases its level or other abilities, nor can it regain expended tek skill slots.

If the simulacrum is damaged, you can repair it in an alchemical laboratory, using rare herbs and minerals worth 10000 credits per hit point it regains. The simulacrum lasts until it drops to 0 hit points, at which point it reverts to snow and melts instantly.

If you cast this tek skill again, any currently active duplicates you created with this tek skill are instantly destroyed.

##### Sleep

_1st-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 90 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 minute

This tek skill sends creatures into a tek slumber. Roll 5d8; the total is how many hit points of creatures this tek skill can affect. Creatures within 20 feet of a point you choose within range are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures).

Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this tek skill falls unconscious until the tek skill ends, the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. Subtract each creature’s hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature’s hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.

Undead and creatures immune to being charmed aren’t affected by this tek skill.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional 2d8 for each slot level above 1st.

##### Sleet Storm

_3rd-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 150 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Until the tek skill ends, freezing rain and sleet fall in a 20-foot-tall cylinder with a 40-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. The area is heavily obscured, and exposed flames in the area are doused.

The ground in the area is covered with slick ice, making it difficult terrain. When a creature enters the tek skill’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it falls prone.

If a creature is concentrating in the tek skill’s area, the creature must make a successful Constitution saving throw against your tek skill save DC or lose concentration.

##### Slow

_3rd-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You alter time around up to six creatures of your choice in a 40-foot cube within range. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by this tek skill for the duration.

An affected target’s speed is halved, it takes a −2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can’t use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creature’s abilities or alien artifacts, it can’t make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.

If the creature attempts to cast a tek skill with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the tek skill doesn’t take effect until the creature’s next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the tek skill. If it can’t, the tek skill is wasted.

A creature affected by this tek skill makes another Wisdom saving throw at the end of its turn. On a successful save, the effect ends for it.

##### Speak with Animals

_1st-level divination (ritual)_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 10 minutes

You gain the ability to comprehend and verbally communicate with beasts for the duration. The knowledge and awareness of many beasts is limited by their intelligence, but at minimum, beasts can give you information about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever they can perceive or have perceived within the past day. You might be able to persuade a beast to perform a small favor for you, at the GM’s discretion.

##### Speak with Dead

_3rd-level necromancy_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 10 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 10 minutes

You grant the semblance of life and intelligence to a corpse of your choice within range, allowing it to answer the questions you pose. The corpse must still have a mouth and can’t be undead. The tek skill fails if the corpse was the target of this tek skill within the last 10 days.

Until the tek skill ends, you can ask the corpse up to five questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This tek skill doesn’t return the creature’s soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse can’t learn new information, doesn’t comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and can’t speculate about future events.

##### Speak with Plants

_3rd-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self (30-foot radius)

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 10 minutes

You imbue plants within 30 feet of you with limited sentience and animation, giving them the ability to communicate with you and follow your simple commands. You can question plants about events in the tek skill’s area within the past day, gaining information about creatures that have passed, weather, and other circumstances.

You can also turn difficult terrain caused by plant growth (such as thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for the duration. Or you can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into difficult terrain that lasts for the duration, causing vines and branches to hinder pursuers, for example.

Plants might be able to perform other tasks on your behalf, at the GM’s discretion. The tek skill doesn’t enable plants to uproot themselves and move about, but they can freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks.

If a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it as if you shared a common language, but you gain no tek ability to influence it.

This tek skill can cause the plants created by the _entangle_ tek skill to release a restrained creature.

##### Spider Climb

_2nd-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

Until the tek skill ends, one willing creature you touch gains the ability to move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving its hands free. The target also gains a climbing speed equal to its walking speed.

##### Spike Growth

_2nd-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 150 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that can’t see the area at the time the tek skill is cast must make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your tek skill save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.

##### Spirit Guardians

_3rd-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self (15-foot radius)

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You call forth spirits to protect you. They flit around you to a distance of 15 feet for the duration. If you are good or neutral, their spectral form appears angelic or fey (your choice). If you are evil, they appear fiendish.

When you cast this tek skill, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it. An affected creature’s speed is halved in the area, and when the creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 radiant damage (if you are good or neutral) or 3d8 radiation damage (if you are evil). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.

##### Spiritual Weapon

_2nd-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 minute

You create a floating, spectral weapon within range that lasts for the duration or until you cast this tek skill again. When you cast the tek skill, you can make a melee tek skill attack against a creature within 5 feet of the weapon. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 1d8 + your Tekcasting ability modifier.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.

The weapon can take whatever form you choose. Clerics of deities who are associated with a particular weapon (as St. Cuthbert is known for his mace and Thor for his hammer) make this tek skill’s effect resemble that weapon.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for every two slot levels above 2nd.

##### Stinking Cloud

_3rd-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 90 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of yellow, nauseating gas centered on a point within range. The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. The cloud lingers in the air for the duration.

Each creature that is completely within the cloud at the start of its turn must make a Constitution saving throw against poison. On a failed save, the creature spends its action that turn retching and reeling. Creatures that don’t need to breathe or are immune to poison automatically succeed on this saving throw.

A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the cloud after 4 rounds. A strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour) disperses it after 1 round.

##### Stone Shape

_4th-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You touch a stone object of Medium size or smaller or a section of stone no more than 5 feet in any dimension and form it into any shape that suits your purpose. So, for example, you could shape a large rock into a weapon, idol, or coffer, or make a small passage through a wall, as long as the wall is less than 5 feet thick. You could also shape a stone door or its frame to seal the door shut. The object you create can have up to two hinges and a latch, but finer mechanical detail isn’t possible.

##### Stoneskin

_4th-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem worth 10000 credits, which the tek skill consumes)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

This tek skill turns the flesh of a willing creature you touch as hard as stone. Until the tek skill ends, the target has resistance to nontek bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

##### Storm of Vengeance

_9th-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Sight

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A churning storm cloud forms, centered on a point you can see and spreading to a radius of 360 feet. Shock flashes in the area, concussive booms, and strong winds roar. Each creature under the cloud (no more than 5,000 feet beneath the cloud) when it appears must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 concussive damage and becomes deafened for 5 minutes.

Each round you maintain concentration on this tek skill, the storm produces additional effects on your turn.

**_Round 2._** Acidic rain falls from the cloud. Each creature and object under the cloud takes 1d6 acid damage.

**_Round 3._** You call six bolts of lightning from the cloud to strike six creatures or objects of your choice beneath the cloud. A given creature or object can’t be struck by more than one bolt. A struck creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**_Round 4._** Hailstones rain down from the cloud. Each creature under the cloud takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage.

**_Round 5–10._** Gusts and freezing rain assail the area under the cloud. The area becomes difficult terrain and is heavily obscured. Each creature there takes 1d6 cold damage. Ranged weapon attacks in the area are impossible. The wind and rain count as a severe distraction for the purposes of maintaining concentration on tek skills. Finally, gusts of strong wind (ranging from 20 to 50 miles per hour) automatically disperse fog, mists, and similar phenomena in the area, whether mundane or tek.

##### Suggestion

_2nd-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 8 hours

You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and influence a creature you can see within range that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the tek skill.

The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the tek skill ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.

You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition isn’t met before the tek skill expires, the activity isn’t performed.

If you or any of your companions damage the target, the tek skill ends.

##### Sunbeam

_6th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self (60-foot line)

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A beam of brilliant light flashes out from your hand in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long line. Each creature in the line must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 radiant damage and is blinded until your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn’t blinded by this tek skill. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.

You can create a new line of radiance as your action on any turn until the tek skill ends.

For the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines in your hand. It sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This light is sunlight.

##### Sunburst

_8th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 150 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Brilliant sunlight flashes in a 60-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. Each creature in that light must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12d6 radiant damage and is blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn’t blinded by this tek skill. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.

A creature blinded by this tek skill makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer blinded.

This tek skill dispels any darkness in its area that was created by a tek skill.

##### Symbol

_7th-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem at least 100,000 credits, which the tek skill consumes)

**Duration:** Until ditek skilled or triggered

When you cast this tek skill, you inscribe a harmful glyph either on a surface (such as a section of floor, a wall, or a table) or within an object that can be closed to conceal the glyph (such as a book, a scroll, or a loot chest). If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this tek skill, the glyph is broken, and the tek skill ends without being triggered.

The glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tek skill save DC to find it.

You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the tek skill. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph.

You can further refine the trigger so the tek skill is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature’s physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.

When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the tek skill ends. Each creature in the sphere when the glyph activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

**_Death._** Each target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d10 radiation damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.

**_Discord._** Each target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target bickers and argues with other creatures for 1 minute. During this time, it is incapable of meaningful communication and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

**_Fear._** Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes frightened for 1 minute on a failed save. While frightened, the target drops whatever it is holding and must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns, if able.

**_Hopelessness._** Each target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target is overwhelmed with despair for 1 minute. During this time, it can’t attack or target any creature with harmful abilities, tek skills, or other tek effects.

**_Insanity._** Each target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target is driven insane for 1 minute. An insane creature can’t take actions, can’t understand what other creatures say, can’t read, and speaks only in gibberish. The GM controls its movement, which is erratic.

**_Pain._** Each target must make a Constitution saving throw and becomes incapacitated with excruciating pain for 1 minute on a failed save.

**_Sleep._** Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and falls unconscious for 10 minutes on a failed save. A creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake.

**_Stunning._** Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes stunned for 1 minute on a failed save.

### Tek Skills (T)

##### Telekinesis

_5th-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You gain the ability to move or manipulate creatures or objects by thought. When you cast the tek skill, and as your action each round for the duration, you can exert your will on one creature or object that you can see within range, causing the appropriate effect below. You can affect the same target round after round, or choose a new one at any time. If you switch targets, the prior target is no longer affected by the tek skill.

**_Creature._** You can try to move a Huge or smaller creature. Make an ability check with your Tekcasting ability contested by the creature’s Strength check. If you win the contest, you move the creature up to 30 feet in any direction, including upward but not beyond the range of this tek skill. Until the end of your next turn, the creature is restrained in your telekinetic grip. A creature lifted upward is suspended in mid-air.

On subsequent rounds, you can use your action to attempt to maintain your telekinetic grip on the creature by repeating the contest.

**_Object._** You can try to move an object that weighs up to 1,000 pounds. If the object isn’t being worn or carried, you automatically move it up to 30 feet in any direction, but not beyond the range of this tek skill.

If the object is worn or carried by a creature, you must make an ability check with your Tekcasting ability contested by that creature’s Strength check. If you succeed, you pull the object away from that creature and can move it up to 30 feet in any direction but not beyond the range of this tek skill.

You can exert fine control on objects with your telekinetic grip, such as manipulating a simple tool, opening a door or a container, stowing or retrieving an item from an open container, or pouring the contents from a vial.

##### Telepathic Bond

_5th-level divination (ritual)_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 hour

You forge a telepathic link among up to eight willing creatures of your choice within range, psychically linking each creature to all the others for the duration. Creatures with Intelligence scores of 2 or less aren’t affected by this tek skill.

Until the tek skill ends, the targets can communicate telepathically through the bond whether or not they have a common language. The communication is possible over any distance, though it can’t extend to other planes of existence.

##### Teleport

_7th-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 10 feet

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Instantaneous

This tek skill instantly transports you and up to eight willing creatures of your choice that you can see within range, or a single object that you can see within range, to a destination you select. If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it can’t be held or carried by an unwilling creature.

The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully. The GM rolls d100 and consults the table.

| Familiarity       | Mishap | Similar Area | Off Target | On Target |
|-------------------|--------|--------------|------------|-----------|
| Permanent circle  | —      | —            | —          | 01–100    |
| Associated object | —      | —            | —          | 01–100    |
| Very familiar     | 01–05  | 06–13        | 14–24      | 25–100    |
| Seen casually     | 01–33  | 34–43        | 44–53      | 54–100    |
| Viewed once       | 01–43  | 44–53        | 54–73      | 74–100    |
| Description       | 01–43  | 44–53        | 54–73      | 74–100    |
| False destination | 01–50  | 51–100       | —          | —         |

**_Familiarity._** “Permanent circle” means a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know. “Associated object” means that you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard’s library, bed linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich’s secret tomb.

“Very familiar” is a place you have been very often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the tek skill. “Seen casually” is someplace you have seen more than once but with which you aren’t very familiar. “Viewed once” is a place you have seen once, possibly using tek. “Description” is a place whose location and appearance you know through someone else’s description, perhaps from a map.

“False destination” is a place that doesn’t exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy’s sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.

**_On Target._** You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.

**_Off Target._** You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The GM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.

**_Similar Area._** You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard’s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the tek skill has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.

**_Mishap._** The tek skill’s unpredictable tek results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the GM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).

##### Teleportation Circle

_5th-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** 10 feet

**Components:** V, M (a gem worth 5000 credits, which the tek skill consumes)

**Duration:** 1 round

As you cast the tek skill, you draw a 10-foot-diameter circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation circle of your choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is on the same plane of existence as you. A shimmering portal opens within the circle you drew and remains open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

Many major temples, guilds, and other important places have permanent teleportation circles inscribed somewhere within their confines. Each such circle includes a unique sigil sequence—a string of tek runes arranged in a particular pattern. When you first gain the ability to cast this tek skill, you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the GM. You can learn additional sigil sequences during your adventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence to memory after studying it for 1 minute.

You can create a permanent teleportation circle by casting this tek skill in the same location every day for one year. You need not use the circle to teleport when you cast the tek skill in this way.

##### Thaumaturgy

_Transmutation cantrip_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Up to 1 minute

You manifest a minor wonder, a sign of supernatural power, within range. You create one of the following tek effects within range:

* Your voice booms up to three times as loud as normal for 1 minute.
* You cause flames to flicker, brighten, dim, or change color for 1 minute.
* You cause harmless tremors in the ground for 1 minute.
* You create an instantaneous sound that originates from a point of your choice within range, such as a rumble of concussive, the cry of a raven, or ominous whispers.
* You instantaneously cause an unlocked door or window to fly open or slam shut.
* You alter the appearance of your eyes for 1 minute. If you cast this tek skill multiple times, you can have up to three of its 1-minute effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

##### Concussivewave

_1st-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self (15-foot cube)

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A wave of concussive force sweeps out from you. Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 concussive damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t pushed.

In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the tek skill’s effect, and the tek skill emits a concussive boom audible out to 300 feet.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

##### Time Stop

_9th-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You briefly stop the flow of time for everyone but yourself. No time passes for other creatures, while you take 1d4 + 1 turns in a row, during which you can use actions and move as normal.

This tek skill ends if one of the actions you use during this period, or any effects that you create during this period, affects a creature other than you or an object being worn or carried by someone other than you. In addition, the tek skill ends if you move to a place more than 1,000 feet from the location where you cast it.

##### Tiny Hut

_3rd-level evocation (ritual)_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** Self (10-foot-radius hemisphere)

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 8 hours

A 10-foot-radius immobile dome of force springs into existence around and above you and remains stationary for the duration. The tek skill ends if you leave its area.

Nine creatures of Medium size or smaller can fit inside the dome with you. The tek skill fails if its area includes a larger creature or more than nine creatures. Creatures and objects within the dome when you cast this tek skill can move through it freely. All other creatures and objects are barred from passing through it. Tek Skills and other tek effects can’t extend through the dome or be cast through it. The atmosphere inside the space is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside.

Until the tek skill ends, you can command the interior to become dimly lit or dark. The dome is opaque from the outside, of any color you choose, but it is transparent from the inside.

##### Tongues

_3rd-level divination_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V

**Duration:** 1 hour

This tek skill grants the creature you touch the ability to understand any spoken language it hears. Moreover, when the target speaks, any creature that knows at least one language and can hear the target understands what it says.

##### Transport via Plants

_6th-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 10 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 round

This tek skill creates a tek link between a Large or larger inanimate plant within range and another plant, at any distance, on the same plane of existence. You must have seen or touched the destination plant at least once before. For the duration, any creature can step into the target plant and exit from the destination plant by using 5 feet of movement.

##### Tree Stride

_5th-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You gain the ability to enter a tree and move from inside it to inside another tree of the same kind within 500 feet. Both trees must be living and at least the same size as you. You must use 5 feet of movement to enter a tree. You instantly know the location of all other trees of the same kind within 500 feet and, as part of the move used to enter the tree, can either pass into one of those trees or step out of the tree you’re in. You appear in a spot of your choice within 5 feet of the destination tree, using another 5 feet of movement. If you have no movement left, you appear within 5 feet of the tree you entered.

You can use this transportation ability once per round for the duration. You must end each turn outside a tree.

##### True Polymorph

_9th-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

Choose one creature or nontek object that you can see within range. You transform the creature into a different creature, the creature into an object, or the object into a creature (the object must be neither worn nor carried by another creature). The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. If you concentrate on this tek skill for the full duration, the transformation lasts until it is ditek skilled.

This tek skill has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points. An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving throw, and if it succeeds, it isn’t affected by this tek skill.

**_Creature into Creature._** If you turn a creature into another kind of creature, the new form can be any kind you choose whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target’s (or its level, if the target doesn’t have a challenge rating). The target’s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the new form. It retains its alignment and personality.

The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn’t knocked unconscious.

The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak, cast tek skills, or take any other action that requires hands or speech, unless its new form is capable of such actions.

The target’s gear melds into the new form. The creature can’t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

**_Object into Creature._** You can turn an object into any kind of creature, as long as the creature’s size is no larger than the object’s size and the creature’s challenge rating is 9 or lower. The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It acts on each of your turns. You decide what action it takes and how it moves. The GM has the creature’s statistics and resolves all of its actions and movement.

If the tek skill becomes permanent, you no longer control the creature. It might remain friendly to you, depending on how you have treated it.

**_Creature into Object._** If you turn a creature into an object, it transforms along with whatever it is wearing and carrying into that form. The creature’s statistics become those of the object, and the creature has no memory of time spent in this form, after the tek skill ends and it returns to its normal form.

##### True Resurrection

_9th-level necromancy_

**Casting Time:** 1 hour

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem worth at least 2500,000 credits, which the tek skill consumes)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You touch a creature that has been dead for no longer than 200 years and that died for any reason except old age. If the creature’s soul is free and willing, the creature is restored to life with all its hit points.

This tek skill closes all wounds, neutralizes any poison, cures all diseases, and lifts any hacks affecting the creature when it died. The tek skill replaces damaged or missing organs and limbs.

The tek skill can even provide a new body if the original no longer exists, in which case you must speak the creature’s name. The creature then appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 10 feet of you.

##### True Seeing

_6th-level divination_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem worth at least 2500 credits, and is consumed by the tek skill)

**Duration:** 1 hour

This tek skill gives the willing creature you touch the ability to see things as they actually are. For the duration, the creature has truesight, notices secret doors hidden by tek, and can see into the Ethereal Plane, all out to a range of 120 feet.

##### True Strike

_Divination cantrip_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 round

You extend your hand and point a finger at a target in range. Your tek grants you a brief insight into the target’s defenses. On your next turn, you gain advantage on your first attack roll against the target, provided that this tek skill hasn’t ended.

### Tek Skills (U)

##### Unseen Servant

_1st-level conjuration (ritual)_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 hour

This tek skill creates an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that performs simple tasks at your command until the tek skill ends. The servant springs into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has AC 10, 1 hit point, and a Strength of 2, and it can’t attack. If it drops to 0 hit points, the tek skill ends.

Once on each of your turns as a bonus action, you can mentally command the servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command.

If you command the servant to perform a task that would move it more than 60 feet away from you, the tek skill ends.

### Tek Skills (V)

##### Vampiric Touch

_3rd-level necromancy_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

The touch of your shadow-wreathed hand can siphon life force from others to heal your wounds. Make a melee tek skill attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 radiation damage, and you regain hit points equal to half the amount of radiation damage dealt. Until the tek skill ends, you can make the attack again on each of your turns as an action.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

### Tek Skills (W)

##### Wall of Fire

_4th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a wall of fire on a solid surface within range. You can make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall is opaque and lasts for the duration.

When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.

One side of the wall, selected by you when you cast this tek skill, deals 5d8 fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side or inside the wall. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.

##### Wall of Force

_5th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

An invisible wall of force springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. It lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice which side).

Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage and can’t be ditek skilled by _dispel tek_. A _disintegrate_ tek skill destroys the wall instantly, however. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through the wall.

##### Wall of Ice

_6th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create a wall of ice on a solid surface within range. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-square panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1 foot thick and lasts for the duration.

If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature within its area is pushed to one side of the wall and must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 cold damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.

The wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. It has AC 12 and 30 hit points per 10-foot section, and it is vulnerable to fire damage. Reducing a 10-foot section of wall to 0 hit points destroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied. A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air for the first time on a turn must make a Constitution saving throw. That creature takes 5d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 7th level or higher, the damage the wall deals when it appears increases by 2d6, and the damage from passing through the sheet of frigid air increases by 1d6, for each slot level above 6th.

##### Wall of Stone

_5th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

A nontek wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten 10-foot* by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.

If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.

The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can’t occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn’t need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this tek skill to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.

If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.

The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the GM’s discretion.

If you maintain your concentration on this tek skill for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can’t be ditek skilled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the tek skill ends.

##### Wall of Thorns

_6th-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create a wall of tough, pliable, tangled brush bristling with needle-sharp thorns. The wall appears within range on a solid surface and lasts for the duration. You choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick. The wall blocks line of sight.

When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7d8 piercing damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.

A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, the first time a creature enters the wall on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 7d8 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this tek skill using a tek skill slot of 7th level or higher, both types of damage increase by 1d8 for each slot level above 6th.

##### Warding Bond

_2nd-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem worth at least 10000 credits, which disappears for the duration)

**Duration:** 1 hour

This tek skill wards a willing creature you touch and creates a mystic connection between you and the target until the tek skill ends. While the target is within 60 feet of you, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and it has resistance to all damage. Also, each time it takes damage, you take the same amount of damage.

The tek skill ends if you drop to 0 hit points or if you and the target become separated by more than 60 feet. It also ends if the tek skill is cast again on either of the connected creatures. You can also dismiss the tek skill as an action.

##### Water Breathing

_3rd-level transmutation (ritual)_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 24 hours

This tek skill grants up to ten willing creatures you can see within range the ability to breathe underwater until the tek skill ends. Affected creatures also retain their normal mode of respiration.

##### Water Walk

_3rd-level transmutation (ritual)_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 hour

This tek skill grants the ability to move across any liquid surface—such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava—as if it were harmless solid ground (creatures crossing molten lava can still take damage from the heat). Up to ten willing creatures you can see within range gain this ability for the duration.

If you target a creature submerged in a liquid, the tek skill carries the target to the surface of the liquid at a rate of 60 feet per round.

##### Web

_2nd-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice within range. The webs fill a 20* foot cube from that point for the duration. The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure their area.

If the webs aren’t anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the tek skill ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.

Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a

Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.

A creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make a Strength check against your tek skill save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.

The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.

##### Weird

_9th-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to one minute

Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create illusory creatures in their minds, visible only to them. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened for the duration. The illusion calls on the creature’s deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares as an implacable threat. At the end of each of the frightened creature’s turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the tek skill ends for that creature.

##### Wind Walk

_6th-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 8 hours

You and up to ten willing creatures you can see within range assume a gaseous form for the duration, appearing as wisps of cloud. While in this cloud form, a creature has a flying speed of 300 feet and has resistance to damage from nontek weapons. The only actions a creature can take in this form are the Dash action or to revert to its normal form. Reverting takes 1 minute, during which time a creature is incapacitated and can’t move. Until the tek skill ends, a creature can revert to cloud form, which also requires the 1-minute transformation.

If a creature is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the creature descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it can’t land after 1 minute, the creature falls the remaining distance.

##### Wind Wall

_3rd-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A wall of strong wind rises from the ground at a point you choose within range. You can make the wall up to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. You can shape the wall in any way you choose so long as it makes one continuous path along the ground. The wall lasts for the duration.

When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Strength saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The strong wind keeps fog, smoke, and other gases at bay. Small or smaller flying creatures or objects can’t pass through the wall. Loose, lightweight materials brought into the wall fly upward. Bullets, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind the wall are deflected upward and automatically miss. (Boulders hurled by giants or siege engines, and similar projectiles, are unaffected.) Creatures in gaseous form can’t pass through it.

##### Wish

_9th-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Instantaneous

*Wish* is the mightiest tek skill a mortal creature can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.

The basic use of this tek skill is to duplicate any other tek skill of 8th level or lower. You don’t need to meet any requirements in that tek skill, including costly components. The tek skill simply takes effect.

Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:

* You create one object of up to 2500,000 credits in value that isn’t a alien artifact. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.
* You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the _greater restoration_ tek skill.
* You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.
* You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single tek skill or other tek effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich’s life drain attack.
* You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a _wish_ tek skill could undo an opponent’s successful save, a foe’s critical hit, or a friend’s failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.

You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The GM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This tek skill might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary alien artifact or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item’s current owner.

The stress of casting this tek skill to produce any effect other than duplicating another tek skill weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a tek skill until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 radiation damage per level of that tek skill. This damage can’t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn’t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast _wish_ ever again if you suffer this stress.

##### Word of Recall

_6th-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 5 feet

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You and up to five willing creatures within 5 feet of you instantly teleport to a previously designated sanctuary. You and any creatures that teleport with you appear in the nearest unoccupied space to the spot you designated when you prepared your sanctuary (see below). If you cast this tek skill without first preparing a sanctuary, the tek skill has no effect.

You must designate a sanctuary by casting this tek skill within a location, such as a temple, dedicated to or strongly linked to your deity. If you attempt to cast the tek skill in this manner in an area that isn’t dedicated to your deity, the tek skill has no effect.

### Tek Skills (X)

### Tek Skills (Y)

### Tek Skills (Z)

##### Zone of Truth

_2nd-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 10 minutes

You create a tek zone that guards against Charm in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range. Until the tek skill ends, a creature that enters the tek skill’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can’t speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw.

An affected creature is aware of the tek skill and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.

## Rare and Tek Items

---

Tek items are presented in alphabetical order. A alien artifact’s description gives the item’s name, its category, its rarity, and its tek properties.

### Adamantine Armor

_Armor (medium or heavy, but not hide), uncommon_

This suit of armor modified to fit humans is reinforced with adamantine, one of the hardest substances found in the solar system. While you’re wearing it, any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit.

### Ammunition, +1, +2, or +3

_Weapon (any ammunition), uncommon (+1), rare (+2), or very rare (+3)_

You have a bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this piece of tek ammunition. The bonus is determined by the rarity of the ammunition. Once it hits a target, the ammunition is no longer tek.

### Amulet of Health

_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)_

Your Constitution score is 19 while you wear this amulet. It has no effect on you if your Constitution is already 19 or higher.

### Amulet of Proof against Detection and Location

_Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)_

While wearing this amulet, you are hidden from divination tek. You can’t be targeted by such tek or perceived through tek scrying sensors.

### Amulet of the Planes

_Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)_

While wearing this amulet, you can use an action to name a location that you are familiar with on another plane of existence. Then make a DC 15 Intelligence check. On a successful check, you cast the _plane shift_ tek skill. On a failure, you and each creature and object within 15 feet of you travel to a random destination. Roll a d100. On a 1–60, you travel to a random location on the plane you named. On a 61–100, you travel to a randomly determined plane of existence.

### Levitating Shield

_Armor (shield), very rare (requires attunement)_

While holding this shield, you can speak its command word as a bonus action to cause it to levitate. The shield leaps into the air and hovers in your space to protect you as if you were wielding it, leaving your hands free. The shield remains animated for 1 minute, until you use a bonus action to end this effect, or until you are incapacitated or die, at which point the shield falls to the ground or into your hand if you have one free.

### Crab Crawler

_Wondrous item, legendary_

This item first appears to be a Large sealed iron barrel weighing 500 pounds. The barrel when activated expands into a vehicle that can crawl on metallic surfaces, and has a minimal propulsion system.

The Crab Crawler is a Large object with the following statistics:

**Armor Class:** 20

**Hit Points:** 200

**Speed:** 30 ft., propulsion 30 ft.

**Damage Immunities:** poison, psychic

To be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus’s hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.

The apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute from pressure.

### Armor, +1, +2, or +3

_Armor (light, medium, or heavy), rare (+1), very rare (+2), or legendary (+3)_

You have a bonus to AC while wearing this armor. The bonus is determined by its rarity.

### Armor of Invulnerability

_Armor (plate), legendary (requires attunement)_

You have resistance to nontek damage while you wear this armor. Additionally, you can use an action to make yourself immune to nontek damage for 10 minutes or until you are no longer wearing the armor. Once this special action is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

### Armor of Resistance

_Armor (light, medium, or heavy), rare (requires attunement)_

You have resistance to one type of damage while you wear this armor. The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly from the options below.

| d10 | Damage Type |
|-----|-------------|
| 1   | Acid        |
| 2   | Cold        |
| 3   | Fire        |
| 4   | Force       |
| 5   | Shock   |
| 6   | Radiation    |
| 7   | Poison      |
| 8   | Psychic     |
| 9   | Radiant     |
| 10  | Concussive     |

### Armor of Vulnerability

_Armor (plate), rare (requires attunement)_

While wearing this armor, you have resistance to one of the following damage types: bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly.

**_Hack_**. This armor is hacked, a fact that is revealed only when an _identify_ tek skill is cast on the armor or you attune to it. Attuning to the armor hacks you until you are targeted by the _remove hack_ tek skill or similar tek; removing the armor fails to end the hack. While hacked, you have vulnerability to two of the three damage types associated with the armor (not the one to which it grants resistance).

### Bullet-Catching Shield

_Armor (shield), rare (requires attunement)_

You gain a +2 bonus to AC against ranged attacks while you wield this shield. This bonus is in addition to the shield’s normal bonus to AC. In addition, whenever an attacker makes a ranged attack against a target within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to become the target of the attack instead.

### Bullet of Slaying

_Weapon (bullet), very rare_

An _bullet of slaying_ is a tek weapon meant to slay a particular kind of creature. Some are more focused than others; for example, there are both _bullets of robot slaying_ and _bullets of abberation slaying_. If a creature belonging to the type, race, or group associated with an _bullet of slaying_ takes damage from the bullet, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one.

Once an _bullet of slaying_ deals its extra damage to a creature, it becomes a nontek bullet.


### Bag of Devouring

_Wondrous item, very rare_

This bag superficially resembles a _bag of holding_ but is a feeding orifice for a gigantic extradimensional creature. Turning the bag inside out closes the orifice.

The extradimensional creature attached to the bag can sense whatever is placed inside the bag. Animal or vegetable matter placed wholly in the bag is devoured and lost forever. When part of a living creature is placed in the bag, as happens when someone reaches inside it, there is a 50 percent chance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A creature inside the bag can use its action to try to escape with a successful DC 15 Strength check. Another creature can use its action to reach into the bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength check (provided it isn’t pulled inside the bag first). Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag is devoured, its body destroyed.

Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which can hold a cubic foot of such material. However, once each day, the bag swallows any objects inside it and spits them out into another plane of existence. The GM determines the time and plane.

If the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and anything contained within it is transported to a random location on the Astral Plane.

### Bag of Holding

_Wondrous item, uncommon_

This bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action.

If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.

Placing a _bag of holding_ inside an extradimensional space created by a _handy haversack_, _portable hole_, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be reopened.

### Bag of Tricks

_Wondrous item, uncommon_

This ordinary bag, made from gray, rust, or tan cloth, appears empty. Reaching inside the bag, however, reveals the presence of a small, fuzzy object. The bag weighs 1/2 pound.

You can use an action to pull the fuzzy object from the bag and throw it up to 20 feet. When the object lands, it transforms into a creature you determine by rolling a d8 and consulting the table that corresponds to the bag’s color.

The creature is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts on your turn. You can use a bonus action to command how the creature moves and what action it takes on its next turn, or to give it general orders, such as to attack your enemies. In the absence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature.

Once three fuzzy objects have been pulled from the bag, the bag can’t be used again until the next dawn.

**Gray Bag of Tricks (table)**

### Bead of Force

_Wondrous item, rare_

This small black sphere measures 3/4 of an inch in diameter and weighs an ounce. Typically, 1d4 + 4 _beads of force_ are found together.

You can use an action to throw the bead up to 60 feet. The bead explodes on impact and is destroyed. Each creature within a 10-foot radius of where the bead landed must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 5d4 force damage. A sphere of transparent force then encloses the area for 1 minute. Any creature that failed the save and is completely within the area is trapped inside this sphere. Creatures that succeeded on the save, or are partially within the area, are pushed away from the center of the sphere until they are no longer inside it. Only breathable air can pass through the sphere’s wall. No attack or other effect can.

An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere’s wall, moving the sphere up to half the creature’s walking speed. The sphere can be picked up, and its tek causes it to weigh only 1 pound, regardless of the weight of creatures inside.

### Belt of Giant Strength

_Wondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement)_

While wearing this belt, your Strength score changes to a score granted by the belt. If your Strength is already equal to or greater than the belt’s score, the item has no effect on you.

Six varieties of this belt exist, corresponding with and having rarity according to the six kinds of true giants. The _belt of stone giant strength_ and the _belt of frost giant strength_ look different, but they have the same effect.

| Type              | Strength | Rarity    |
|-------------------|----------|-----------|
| Hill giant        | 21       | Rare      |
| Stone/frost giant | 23       | Very rare |
| Fire giant        | 25       | Very rare |
| Cloud giant       | 27       | Legendary |
| Storm giant       | 29       | Legendary |

### Berserker Axe

_Weapon (any axe), rare (requires attunement)_

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this pulse tek weapon. In addition, while you are attuned to this weapon, your hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained.

**_Hack_**. This axe is hacked, and becoming attuned to it extends the hack to you. As long as you remain hacked, you are unwilling to part with the axe, keeping it within reach at all times. You also have disadvantage on attack rolls with weapons other than this one, unless no foe is within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear.

Whenever a hostile creature damages you while the axe is in your possession, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or go berserk. While berserk, you must use your action each round to attack the creature nearest to you with the axe. If you can make extra attacks as part of the Attack action, you use those extra attacks, moving to attack the next nearest creature after you fell your current target. If you have multiple possible targets, you attack one at random. You are berserk until you start your turn with no creatures within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear.

### Boots of Speed

_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)_

While you wear these boots, you can use a bonus action and click the boots’ heels together. If you do, the boots double your walking speed, and any creature that makes an opportunity attack against you has disadvantage on the attack roll. If you click your heels together again, you end the effect.

When the boots’ property has been used for a total of 10 minutes, the tek ceases to function until you finish a long rest.

### Boots of Striding and Springing

_Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)_

While you wear these boots, your walking speed becomes 30 feet, unless your walking speed is higher, and your speed isn’t reduced if you are encumbered or wearing heavy armor.

This cape smells faintly of brimstone. While wearing it, you can use it to cast the _dimension door_ tek skill as an action. This property of the cape can’t be used again until the next dawn.

When you disappear, you leave behind a cloud of smoke, and you appear in a similar cloud of smoke at your destination. The smoke lightly obscures the space you left and the space you appear in, and it dissipates at the end of your next turn. A light or stronger wind disperses the smoke.

### Hoverboard

_Wondrous item, very rare_

You can speak the board's command word as an action to make the carpet hover and fly. It moves according to your spoken directions, provided that you are within 30 feet of it.

Four sizes of _hoverboard_ exist. The GM chooses the size of a given carpet or determines it randomly.

| d100   | Size          | Capacity | Flying Speed |
|--------|---------------|----------|--------------|
| 01–20  | 3 ft. × 5 ft. | 200 kg.  | 80 feet      |

This handheld remote has a single button. While pointing it at an object within 120 feet of you that can be opened, such as a door, lid, or lock. the remote issues a clear tone, and one lock or latch on the object opens unless the signal can’t reach the object.

The remote can be used ten times. After the tenth time, it runs out of energy and becomes useless.

### Circlet of Blasting

*requires a tekcaster*

While wearing this circlet, you can use an action to cast the _scorching ray_ tek skill with it. When you make the tek skill’s attacks, you do so with an attack bonus of +5. The circlet can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.

### Suit of Displacement

_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)_

While you wear this cloak, it projects an illusion that makes you appear to be standing in a place near your actual location, causing any creature to have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. If you take damage, the property ceases to function until the start of your next turn. This property is suppressed while you are incapacitated, restrained, or otherwise unable to move.

### Ghost Cloak

If you ever fail to grip the cloak’s edges while flying in this way, or if you are no longer in dim light or darkness, you lose this flying speed.

While wearing the cloak in an area of dim light or darkness, you can use your action to cast _polymorph_ on yourself, transforming into a bat.

_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)_

This cube is about an inch across. Each face has a distinct marking on it that can be pressed. The cube starts with 36 charges, and it regains 1d20 expended charges daily at dawn.

You can use an action to press one of the cube’s faces, expending a number of charges based on the chosen face, as shown in the Cube of Force Faces table. Each face has a different effect. If the cube has insufficient charges remaining, nothing happens. Otherwise, a barrier of invisible force springs into existence, forming a cube 15 feet on a side. The barrier is centered on you, moves with you, and lasts for 1 minute, until you use an action to press the cube’s sixth face, or the cube runs out of charges. You can change the barrier’s effect by pressing a different face of the cube and expending the requisite number of charges, resetting the duration.

If your movement causes the barrier to come into contact with a solid object that can’t pass through the cube, you can’t move any closer to that object as long as the barrier remains.

**Cube of Force Faces (table)**

| Face | Charges | Effect                                                                                                            |
|------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | 1       | Gases, wind, and fog can’t pass through the barrier.                                                              |
| 2    | 2       | Nonliving matter can’t pass through the barrier. Walls, floors, and ceilings can pass through at your discretion. |
| 3    | 3       | Living matter can’t pass through the barrier.                                                                     |

| 6    | 0       | The barrier deactivates.                                                                                          |

The cube loses charges when the barrier is targeted by certain tek skills or comes into contact with certain tek skill or alien artifact effects, as shown in the table below.

| Tek or Item    | Charges Lost |
|------------------|--------------|
| Disintegrate     | 1d12         |

### Dancing Sword

_Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)_

You can use a bonus action to toss this tek sword into the air and speak the command word. When you do so, the sword begins to hover, flies up to 30 feet, and attacks one creature of your choice within 5 feet of it. The sword uses your attack roll and ability score modifier to damage rolls.

While the sword hovers, you can use a bonus action to cause it to fly up to 30 feet to another spot within 30 feet of you. As part of the same bonus action, you can cause the sword to attack one creature within 5 feet of it.

After the hovering sword attacks for the fourth time, it flies up to 30 feet and tries to return to your hand. If you have no hand free, it falls to the ground at your feet.

### Defender

_Weapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunement)_

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this tek weapon.

The first time you attack with the sword on each of your turns, you can transfer some or all of the sword’s bonus to your Armor Class, instead of using the bonus on any attacks that turn. For example, you could reduce the bonus to your attack and damage rolls to +1 and gain a +2 bonus to AC. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn, although you must hold the sword to gain a bonus to AC from it.

### Demon Armor

_Armor (plate), very rare (requires attunement)_

While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you can understand and speak Abyssal. In addition, the armor’s clawed gauntlets turn unarmed strikes with your hands into tek weapons that deal slashing damage, with a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls and a damage die of 1d8.

### Dragon Kevlar

_Armor (kevlar), very rare (requires attunement)_

While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, you have advantage on saving throws against the Frightful Presence and breath weapons of dragons, and you have resistance to one damage type that is determined by the kind of dragon that provided the scales (see the table).

Additionally, you can focus your senses as an action to discern the distance and direction to the closest dragon within 30 miles of you that is of the same type as the armor. This special action can’t be used again until the next dawn.

### Dust of Disappearance

_Wondrous item, uncommon_

Found in a small packet, this powder resembles very fine sand. There is enough of it for one use. When you use an action to throw the dust into the air, you and each creature and object within 10 feet of you become invisible for 2d4 minutes. The duration is the same for all subjects, and the dust is consumed when its tek takes effect. If a creature affected by the dust attacks or casts a tek skill, the invisibility ends for that creature.

### Dust of Dryness

_Wondrous item, uncommon_

This small packet contains 1d6 + 4 pinches of dust. You can use an action to sprinkle a pinch of it over water. The dust turns a cube of water 15 feet on a side into one marble-sized pellet, which floats or rests near where the dust was sprinkled. The pellet’s weight is negligible.

Someone can use an action to smash the pellet against a hard surface, causing the pellet to shatter and release the water the dust absorbed. Doing so ends that pellet’s tek.

An elemental composed mostly of water that is exposed to a pinch of the dust must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 radiation damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Dust of Sneezing and Choking

_Wondrous item, uncommon_

Found in a small container, this powder resembles very fine sand. It appears to be _dust of disappearance_, and an _identify_ tek skill reveals it to be such. There is enough of it for one use.

When you use an action to throw a handful of the dust into the air, you and each creature that needs to breathe within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become unable to breathe, while sneezing uncontrollably. A creature affected in this way is incapacitated and suffocating. As long as it is conscious, a creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on it on a success. The _lesser restoration_ tek skill can also end the effect on a creature.

### Light Scarab Skin

_Armor (scarab skin), rare_

You gain a +1 bonus to AC while you wear this armor. You are considered proficient with this armor even if you lack proficiency with medium armor.

### Bionic Eye

_Wondrous item, uncommon_

This crystal lens fits over the eye like a contact. While wearing it, you can see much better than normal out to a range of 1 foot. You have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks that rely on sight while inspecting tiny objects such as circuit boards or nanotechnology.

### Eyes of the Eagle

_Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)_

These contact lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing them, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. In conditions of clear visibility, you can make out details of even extremely distant creatures and objects as small as 2 feet across.

### Flame Tongue

_Weapon (any sword), rare (requires attunement)_

You can use a bonus action to speak this tek sword’s command word, causing flames to erupt from the blade. These flames shed bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. While the sword is ablaze, it deals an extra 2d6 fire damage to any target it hits. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or sheathe the sword.

### Folding Shuttle

_Wondrous item, rare_

This is a box the size of a large suitcase. When activated it folds out into a miniature shuttle that can hold 2 passengers. It has enough oxygen for 10 hours, and a minor propulsion system that can accelerate up to .2g.

### Frost Brand

_Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)_

When you hit with an attack using this tek sword, the target takes an extra 1d6 cold damage. In addition, while you hold the sword, you have resistance to fire damage.

In freezing temperatures, the blade sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.

When you draw this weapon, you can extinguish all nontek flames within 30 feet of you. This property can be used no more than once per hour.

### Giant Slayer

_Weapon (any axe or sword), rare_

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this tek weapon.

When you hit a giant with it, the giant takes an extra 2d6 damage of the weapon’s type and must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or fall prone. For the purpose of this weapon, “giant” refers to any creature with the giant type, including ettins and trolls.

### Glamoured flak armor

_Armor (flak armor), rare_

While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. You can also use a bonus action to speak the armor’s command word and cause the armor to assume the appearance of a normal set of clothing or some other kind of armor. You decide what it looks like, including color, style, and accessories, but the armor retains its normal bulk and weight. The illusory appearance lasts until you use this property again or remove the armor.

### Gloves of Missile Snaring

_Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)_

These gloves seem to almost meld into your hands when you don them. When a ranged weapon attack hits you while you’re wearing them, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier, provided that you have a free hand. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in that hand.

### Gloves of Swimming and Climbing

_Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)_

While wearing these gloves, climbing and swimming don’t cost you extra movement, and you gain a +5 bonus to Strength (Physique) checks made to climb or swim.

### Nightvision Goggles

_Wondrous item, uncommon_

While wearing these dark lenses, you have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, wearing the goggles increases its range by 60 feet.

### Collar of Disguise

_Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)_

While wearing this collar, you can use an action to cast the _disguise self_ tek skill from it at will. The collar distorts the light around your face to make it appear different. Your facial movements are mimiced by the illusion. The tek skill ends if the collar is removed.

### Headband of Intellect

_Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)_

This headband has nodes that connect to your brain, giving you access to information in its memory bank. Your Intelligence score is 19 while you wear this headband. It has no effect on you if your Intelligence is already 19 or higher.

### Earpiece of Comprehending Languages

_Wondrous item, uncommon_

While wearing this earpiece, you can use an action to cast the _comprehend languages_ tek skill from it at will.

### Luck Blade

_Weapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunement)_

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this tek weapon. While the sword is on your person, you also gain a +1 bonus to saving throws.

**_Luck_**. If the sword is on your person, you can call on its luck (no action required) to reroll one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw you dislike. You must use the second roll. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.

**_Wish_**. The sword has 1d4 – 1 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and cast the _wish_ tek skill from it. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn. The sword loses this property if it has no charges.

### Mantle of Tek Resistance

_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)_

You have advantage on saving throws against tek skills while you wear this cloak.

### Mithral Armor

_Armor (medium or heavy, but not hide), uncommon_

Mithral is a light, flexible metal. A mithral scarab skin or breastplate can be worn under normal clothes. If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement, the mithral version of the armor doesn’t.

### Oil of Sharpness

_Potion, very rare_

This clear, gelatinous oil sparkles with tiny, ultrathin silver shards. The oil can coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition. Applying the oil takes 1 minute. For 1 hour, the coated item is tek and has a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls.

### Oil of Slipperiness

_Potion, uncommon_

This sticky black unguent is thick and heavy in the container, but it flows quickly when poured. The oil can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment it’s wearing and carrying (one additional vial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of a _freedom of movement_ tek skill for 8 hours.

Alternatively, the oil can be poured on the ground as an action, where it covers a 10-foot square, duplicating the effect of the _grease_ tek skill in that area for 8 hours.

### Pearl of Power

_Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a tekcaster)_

While this pearl is on your person, you can use an action to speak its command word and regain one expended tek skill slot. If the expended slot was of 4th level or higher, the new slot is 3rd level. Once you use the pearl, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

### Periapt of Wound Closure

_Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)_

While you wear this pendant, you stabilize whenever you are dying at the start of your turn. In addition, whenever you roll a Hit Die to regain hit points, double the number of hit points it restores.

### Portable Hole

_Wondrous item, rare_

This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.

You can use an action to unfold a _portable hole_ and place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the _portable hole_ creates an extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane, so it can’t be used to create open passages. Any creature inside an open _portable hole_ can exit the hole by climbing out of it.

You can use an action to close a _portable hole_ by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what’s in it, the hole weighs next to nothing.

If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole’s extradimensional space can use an action to make a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the _portable hole_ or the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within a closed _portable hole_ can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.

Placing a _portable hole_ inside an extradimensional space created by a _bag of holding_, _handy haversack_, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be reopened.

### Potion of Climbing

_Potion, common_

When you drink this potion, you gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed for 1 hour. During this time, you have advantage on Strength (Physique) checks you make to climb. The potion is separated into brown, silver, and gray layers resembling bands of stone. Shaking the bottle fails to mix the colors.

### Injection of Giant Strength

_Potion, rarity varies_

When you inject this drug, your Strength score changes for 1 hour. The type of giant determines the score (see the table below). The drug has no effect on you if your Strength is equal to or greater than that score.

This potion’s transparent liquid has floating in it a sliver of fingernail from a giant of the appropriate type. The _potion of frost giant strength_ and the _potion of stone giant strength_ have the same effect.

| Type of Giant     | Strength | Rarity    |
|-------------------|----------|-----------|
| Hill giant        | 21       | Uncommon  |
| Frost/stone giant | 23       | Rare      |
| Fire giant        | 25       | Rare      |
| Cloud giant       | 27       | Very rare |
| Storm giant       | 29       | Legendary |

### Potion of Healing

_Potion, rarity varies_

You regain hit points when you drink this potion. The number of hit points depends on the potion’s rarity, as shown in the Potions of Healing table. Whatever its potency, the potion’s red liquid glimmers when agitated.

**Potions of Healing (table)**

| Potion of ...    | Rarity    | HP Regained |
|------------------|-----------|-------------|
| Healing          | Common    | 2d4 + 2     |
| Greater healing  | Uncommon  | 4d4 + 4     |
| Superior healing | Rare      | 8d4 + 8     |
| Supreme healing  | Very rare | 10d4 + 20   |

### Potion of Heroism

_Potion, rare_

For 1 hour after drinking it, you gain 10 temporary hit points that last for 1 hour. For the same duration, you are under the effect of the _bless_ tek skill (no concentration required). This blue potion bubbles and steams as if boiling.

### Potion of Poison

_Potion, uncommon_

This concoction looks, smells, and tastes like a _potion of healing_ or other beneficial potion. However, it is actually poison masked by illusion tek. An _identify_ tek skill reveals its true nature.

If you drink it, you take 3d6 poison damage, and you must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned. At the start of each of your turns while you are poisoned in this way, you take 3d6 poison damage. At the end of each of your turns, you can repeat the saving throw. On a successful save, the poison damage you take on your subsequent turns decreases by 1d6. The poison ends when the damage decreases to 0.

### Potion of Resistance

_Potion, uncommon_

When you drink this potion, you gain resistance to one type of damage for 1 hour. The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly from the options below.

| d10 | Damage Type |
|-----|-------------|
| 1   | Acid        |
| 2   | Cold        |
| 3   | Fire        |
| 4   | Force       |
| 5   | Shock   |
| 6   | Radiation    |
| 7   | Poison      |
| 8   | Psychic     |
| 9   | Radiant     |
| 10  | Concussive     |

### Potion of Speed

_Potion, very rare_

When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the _haste_ tek skill for 1 minute (no concentration required). The potion’s yellow fluid is streaked with black and swirls on its own.

### Restorative Ointment

_Wondrous item, uncommon_

This glass jar, 3 inches in diameter, contains 1d4 + 1 doses of a thick mixture that smells faintly of aloe. The jar and its contents weigh 1/2 pound.

As an action, one dose of the ointment can be swallowed or applied to the skin. The creature that receives it regains 2d8 + 2 hit points, ceases to be poisoned, and is cured of any disease.

### Ring of Telekinesis

_Ring, very rare (requires attunement)_

While wearing this ring, you can cast the _telekinesis_ tek skill at will, but you can target only objects that aren’t being worn or carried.

### Rope of Climbing

_Wondrous item, uncommon_

This 60-foot length of silk rope weighs 3 pounds and can hold up to 3,000 pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak the command word, the rope animates. As a bonus action, you can command the other end to move toward a destination you choose. That end moves 10 feet on your turn when you first command it and 10 feet on each of your turns until reaching its destination, up to its maximum length away, or until you tell it to stop. You can also tell the rope to fasten itself securely to an object or to unfasten itself, to knot or unknot itself, or to coil itself for carrying.

If you tell the rope to knot, large knots appear at 1* foot intervals along the rope. While knotted, the rope shortens to a 50-foot length and grants advantage on checks made to climb it.

The rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.

### Rope of Entanglement

_Wondrous item, rare_

This rope is 30 feet long and weighs 3 pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak its command word, the other end darts forward to entangle a creature you can see within 20 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or become restrained.

You can release the creature by using a bonus action to speak a second command word. A target restrained by the rope can use an action to make a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity check (target’s choice). On a success, the creature is no longer restrained by the rope.

The rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.

### Pulse Shield, +1, +2, or +3

_Armor (shield), uncommon (+1), rare (+2), or very rare (+3)_

While holding this shield, you have a bonus to AC determined by the shield’s rarity. This bonus is in addition to the shield’s normal bonus to AC.

### Shield of Missile Attraction

_Armor (shield), rare (requires attunement)_

While holding this shield, you have resistance to damage from ranged weapon attacks.

**_Hack_**. This shield is hacked. Attuning to it hacks you until you are targeted by the _remove hack_ tek skill or similar tek. Removing the shield fails to end the hack on you. Whenever a ranged weapon attack is made against a target within 10 feet of you, the hack causes you to become the target instead.

### Sovereign Glue

_Wondrous item, legendary_

This viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond between any two objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated inside with _oil of slipperiness._ When found, a container contains 1d6 + 1 ounces.

One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square surface. The glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of _universal solvent_ or _oil of etherealness_, or with a _wish_ tek skill.

### Tekguard Shield

_Armor (shield), very rare (requires attunement)_

While holding this shield, you have advantage on saving throws against tek skills and other tek effects, and tek skill attacks have disadvantage against you.

### Sword of Sharpness

_Weapon (any sword that deals slashing damage), very rare (requires attunement)_

When you attack an object with this tek sword and hit, maximize your weapon damage dice against the target.

When you attack a creature with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, that target takes an extra 4d6 slashing damage. Then roll another d20. If you roll a 20, you lop off one of the target’s limbs, with the effect of such loss determined by the GM. If the creature has no limb to sever, you lop off a portion of its body instead.

In addition, you can speak the sword’s command word to cause the blade to shed bright light in a 10* foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. Speaking the command word again or sheathing the sword puts out the light.

### Sword of Wounding

_Weapon (any sword), rare (requires attunement)_

Hit points lost to this weapon’s damage can be regained only through a short or long rest, rather than by regeneration, tek, or any other means.

Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack using this tek weapon, you can wound the target. At the start of each of the wounded creature’s turns, it takes 1d4 radiation damage for each time you’ve wounded it, and it can then make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, ending the effect of all such wounds on itself on a success. Alternatively, the wounded creature, or a creature within 5 feet of it, can use an action to make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check, ending the effect of such wounds on it on a success.

### Universal Solvent

_Wondrous item, legendary_

This tube holds milky liquid with a strong alcohol smell. You can use an action to pour the contents of the tube onto a surface within reach. The liquid instantly dissolves up to 1 square foot of adhesive it touches, including _sovereign glue._

### Vicious Weapon

_Weapon (any), rare_

When you roll a 20 on your attack roll with this tek weapon, your critical hit deals an extra 2d6 damage of the weapon’s type.

### Vorpal Sword

_Weapon (any sword that deals slashing damage), legendary (requires attunement)_

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this tek weapon. In addition, the weapon ignores resistance to slashing damage.

When you attack a creature that has at least one head with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature’s heads. The creature dies if it can’t survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, doesn’t have or need a head, has legendary actions, or the GM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 6d8 slashing damage from the hit.

### Weapon, +1, +2, or +3

_Weapon (any), uncommon (+1), rare (+2), or very rare (+3)_

You have a bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this tek weapon. The bonus is determined by the weapon’s rarity.

### Wind Fan

_Wondrous item, uncommon_

While holding this fan, you can use an action to cast the _gust of wind_ tek skill (save DC 13) from it. Once used, the fan shouldn’t be used again until the next dawn. Each time it is used again before then, it has a cumulative 20 percent chance of not working and tearing into useless, nontek tatters.

### Grav Boots

_Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)_

While you wear these boots, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can use the boots to fly for up to 4 hours, all at once or in several shorter flights, each one using a minimum of 1 minute from the duration. If you are flying when the duration expires, you descend at a rate of 30 feet per round until you land.

The boots regain 2 hours of flying capability for every 12 hours they aren’t in use.

### Jet Pack

_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)_

The jetpack gives you a flying speed of 60 feet for 1 hour. You can’t use them again for 1d12 hours.

## Sentient Alien Artifacts

Some alien artifacts possess sentience and personality; self-aware thanks to the tek used to create it. The item behaves like a character, complete with personality quirks, ideals, bonds, and sometimes flaws. A sentient item might be a cherished ally to its wielder or a continual thorn in the side.

Most sentient items are weapons. Other kinds of items can manifest sentience, but consumable items such as potions and scrolls are never sentient.

Sentient alien artifacts function as NPCs under the GM’s control. Any activated property of the item is under the item’s control, not its wielder’s. As long as the wielder maintains a good relationship with the item, the wielder can access those properties normally. If the relationship is strained, the item can suppress its activated properties or even turn them against the wielder.

### Creating Sentient Alien Artifacts

When you decide to make a alien artifact sentient, you create the item’s persona in the same way you would create an NPC, with a few exceptions described here.

### Abilities

A sentient alien artifact has Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You can choose the item’s abilities or determine them randomly. To determine them randomly, roll 4d6 for each one, dropping the lowest roll and totaling the rest.

### Communication

A sentient item has some ability to communicate, either by sharing its emotions, broadcasting its thoughts telepathically, or speaking aloud. You can choose how it communicates or roll on the following table.

| d100   | Communication                                                                                                                                                      |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 01–60  | The item communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it.                                                                             |
| 61–90  | The item can speak, read, and understand one or more languages.                                                                                                    |
| 91–100 | The item can speak, read, and understand one or more languages. In addition, the item can communicate telepathically with any character that carries or wields it. |

### Senses

With sentience comes awareness. A sentient item can perceive its surroundings out to a limited range. You can choose its senses or roll on the following table.

| d4 | Senses                                     |
|----|--------------------------------------------|
| 1  | Hearing and normal vision out to 30 feet.  |
| 2  | Hearing and normal vision out to 60 feet   |
| 3  | Hearing and normal vision out to 120 feet. |
| 4  | Hearing and darkvision out to 120 feet.    |

### Alignment

A sentient alien artifact has an alignment. Its creator or nature might suggest an alignment. If not, you can pick an alignment or roll on the following table.

| d100   | Alignment       |
|--------|-----------------|
| 01–15  | Lawful good     |
| 16–35  | Neutral good    |
| 36–50  | Chaotic good    |
| 51–63  | Lawful neutral  |
| 64–73  | Neutral         |
| 74–85  | Chaotic neutral |
| 86–89  | Lawful evil     |
| 90–96  | Neutral evil    |
| 97–100 | Chaotic evil    |

### Special Purpose

You can give a sentient item an objective it pursues, perhaps to the exclusion of all else. As long as the wielder’s use of the item aligns with that special purpose, the item remains cooperative. Deviating from this course might cause conflict between the wielder and the item, and could even cause the item to prevent the use of its activated properties. You can pick a special purpose or roll on the following table.

| d10 | Purpose                                                                                                                                  |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | _Aligned:_ The item seeks to defeat or destroy those of a diametrically opposed alignment. (Such an item is never neutral.)              |
| 2   | _Bane:_ The item seeks to defeat or destroy creatures of a particular kind, such as fiends, shapechangers, trolls, or wizards.           |
| 3   | _Protector:_ The item seeks to defend a particular race or kind of creature, such as elves or druids.                                    |
| 4   | _Crusader:_ The item seeks to defeat, weaken, or destroy the servants of a particular deity.                                             |
| 5   | _Templar_: The item seeks to defend the servants and interests of a particular deity.                                                    |
| 6   | _Destroyer:_ The item craves destruction and goads its user to fight arbitrarily.                                                        |
| 7   | _Glory Seeker:_ The item seeks renown as the greatest alien artifact in the world, by establishing its user as a famous or notorious figure. |
| 8   | _Lore Seeker:_ The item craves knowledge or is determined to solve a mystery, learn a secret, or unravel a cryptic prophecy.             |
| 9   | _Destiny Seeker:_ The item is convinced that it and its wielder have key roles to play in future events.                                 |
| 10  | _Creator Seeker:_ The item seeks its creator and wants to understand why it was created.                                                 |

### Conflict

A sentient item has a will of its own, shaped by its personality and alignment. If its wielder acts in a manner opposed to the item’s alignment or purpose, conflict can arise. When such a conflict occurs, the item makes a Charisma check contested by the wielder’s Charisma check. If the item wins the contest, it makes one or more of the following demands:

* The item insists on being carried or worn at all times.
* The item demands that its wielder dispose of anything the item finds repugnant.
* The item demands that its wielder pursue the item’s goals to the exclusion of all other goals.
* The item demands to be given to someone else. If its wielder refuses to comply with the item’s wishes, the item can do any or all of the following:

* Make it impossible for its wielder to attune to it.
* Suppress one or more of its activated properties.
* Attempt to take control of its wielder.

If a sentient item attempts to take control of its wielder, the wielder must make a Charisma saving throw, with a DC equal to 12 + the item’s Charisma modifier. On a failed save, the wielder is charmed by the item for 1d12 hours. While charmed, the wielder must try to follow the item’s commands. If the wielder takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. Whether the attempt to control its user succeeds or fails, the item can’t use this power again until the next dawn.

A monster’s statistics, sometimes referred to as its **stat block**, provide the essential information that you need to run the monster.

>**Modifying Creatures**
>
>Despite the versatile collection of monsters in this book, you might be at a loss when it comes to finding the perfect creature for part of an adventure. Feel free to tweak an existing creature to make it into something more useful for you, perhaps by borrowing a trait or two from a different monster or by using a **variant** or **template**, such as the ones in this book. Keep in mind that modifying a monster, including when you apply a template to it, might change its challenge rating.

#### Size

A monster can be Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, or Gargantuan. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. See the _Player’s Handbook_ for more information on creature size and space.

**Size Categories (table)**

| Size       | Space                  | Examples            |
|------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Tiny       | 2½ by 2½ ft.           | Imp, sprite         |
| Small      | 5 by 5 ft.             | Giant rat, goblin   |
| Medium     | 5 by 5 ft.             | Orc, werewolf       |
| Large      | 10 by 10 ft.           | Hippogriff, ogre    |
| Huge       | 15 by 15 ft.           | Fire giant, treant  |
| Gargantuan | 20 by 20 ft. or larger | Kraken, purple worm |

#### Type

A monster’s type speaks to its fundamental nature. Certain tek skills, alien artifacts, class features, and other effects in the game interact in special ways with creatures of a particular type. For example, an _bullet of dragon slaying_ deals extra damage not only to dragons but also other creatures of the dragon type, such as dragon turtles and wyverns.

The game includes the following monster types, which have no rules of their own.

**Aberrations** are utterly alien beings. Many of them have innate tek abilities drawn from the creature’s alien mind rather than the mystical forces of the world. The quintessential aberrations are aboleths, beholders, mind flayers, and slaadi.

**Beasts** are nonhumanoid creatures that are a natural part of the futuristic ecology. Some of them have tek powers, but most are unintelligent and lack any society or language. Beasts include all varieties of ordinary animals, dinosaurs, and giant versions of animals.

**Celestials** are creatures native to the Upper

Planes. Many of them are the servants of deities, employed as messengers or agents in the mortal realm and throughout the planes. Celestials are good by nature, so the exceptional celestial who strays from a good alignment is a horrifying rarity. Celestials include angels, couatls, and pegasi.

**Constructs** are made, not born. Some are programmed by their creators to follow a simple set of instructions, while others are imbued with sentience and capable of independent thought. Golems are the iconic constructs. Many creatures native to the outer plane of Mechanus, such as modrons, are constructs shaped from the raw material of the plane by the will of more powerful creatures.

**Dragons** are large reptilian creatures of ancient origin and tremendous power. True dragons, including the good metallic dragons and the evil chromatic dragons, are highly intelligent and have innate tek. Also in this category are creatures distantly related to true dragons, but less powerful, less intelligent, and less tek, such as wyverns and pseudodragons.

**Elementals** are creatures native to the elemental planes. Some creatures of this type are little more than animate masses of their respective elements, including the creatures simply called elementals. Others have biological forms infused with elemental energy. The races of genies, including djinn and efreet, form the most important civilizations on the elemental planes. Other elemental creatures include azers, invisible stalkers, and water weirds.

**Fey** are tek creatures closely tied to the forces of nature. They dwell in twilight groves and misty forests. In some worlds, they are closely tied to the Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie. Some are also found in the Outer Planes, particularly the planes of Arborea and the Beastlands. Fey include dryads, pixies, and satyrs.

**Fiends** are creatures of wickedness that are native to the Lower Planes. A few are the servants of deities, but many more labor under the leadership of archdevils and demon princes. Evil priests and mages sometimes summon fiends to the material world to do their bidding. If an evil celestial is a rarity, a good fiend is almost inconceivable. Fiends include demons, devils, hell hounds, rakshasas, and yugoloths.

**Giants** tower over humans and their kind. They are humanlike in shape, though some have multiple heads (ettins) or deformities (fomorians). The six varieties of true giant are hill giants, stone giants, frost giants, fire giants, cloud giants, and storm giants. Besides these, creatures such as ogres and trolls are giants.

**Humanoids** are the main peoples of a futuristic gaming world, both civilized and savage, including humans and a tremendous variety of other species. They have language and culture, few if any innate tek abilities (though most humanoids can learn Tekcasting), and a bipedal form. The most common humanoid races are the ones most suitable as player characters: humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings. Almost as numerous but far more savage and brutal, and almost uniformly evil, are the races of goblinoids (goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears), orcs, gnolls, lizardfolk, and kobolds.

**Monstrosities** are monsters in the strictest sense—frightening creatures that are not ordinary, not truly natural, and almost never benign. Some are the results of tek experimentation gone awry (such as owlbears), and others are the product of terrible hacks (including minotaurs and yuan-ti). They defy categorization, and in some sense serve as a catch-all category for creatures that don’t fit into any other type.

**Oozes** are gelatinous creatures that rarely have a fixed shape. They are mostly subterranean, dwelling in caves and dungeons and feeding on refuse, carrion, or creatures unlucky enough to get in their way. Black puddings and gelatinous cubes are among the most recognizable oozes.

**Plants** in this context are vegetable creatures, not ordinary flora. Most of them are ambulatory, and some are carnivorous. The quintessential plants are the shambling mound and the treant. Fungal creatures such as the gas spore and the myconid also fall into this category.

**Undead** are once-living creatures brought to a horrifying state of undeath through the practice of necromantic tek or some unholy hack. Undead include walking corpses, such as vampires and zombies, as well as bodiless spirits, such as ghosts and specters.

##### Tags

A monster might have one or more tags appended to its type, in parentheses. For example, an orc has the _humanoid (orc)_ type. The parenthetical tags provide additional categorization for certain creatures. The tags have no rules of their own, but something in the game, such as a alien artifact, might refer to them. For instance, a spear that is especially effective at fighting demons would work against any monster that has the demon tag.

#### Alignment

A monster’s alignment provides a clue to its disposition and how it behaves in a roleplaying or combat situation. For example, a chaotic evil monster might be difficult to reason with and might attack characters on sight, whereas a neutral monster might be willing to negotiate. See the _Player’s Handbook_ for descriptions of the different alignments.

The alignment specified in a monster’s stat block is the default. Feel free to depart from it and change a monster’s alignment to suit the needs of your campaign. If you want a good-aligned green dragon or an evil storm giant, there’s nothing stopping you.

Some creatures can have **any alignment**. In other words, you choose the monster’s alignment. Some monster’s alignment entry indicates a tendency or aversion toward law, chaos, good, or evil. For example, a berserker can be any chaotic alignment (chaotic good, chaotic neutral, or chaotic evil), as befits its wild nature.

Many creatures of low intelligence have no comprehension of law or chaos, good or evil. They don’t make moral or ethical choices, but rather act on instinct. These creatures are **unaligned**, which means they don’t have an alignment.

#### Armor Class

A monster that wears armor or carries A medkit has an Armor Class (AC) that takes its armor, shield, and Dexterity into account. Otherwise, a monster’s AC is based on its Dexterity modifier and natural armor, if any. If a monster has natural armor, wears armor, or carries A medkit, this is noted in parentheses after its AC value.

#### Hit Points

A monster usually dies or is destroyed when it drops to 0 hit points. For more on hit points, see the _Player’s Handbook_.

A monster’s hit points are presented both as a die expression and as an average number. For example, a monster with 2d8 hit points has 9 hit points on average (2 × 4½).

A monster’s size determines the die used to calculate its hit points, as shown in the Hit Dice by Size table.

#### Hit Dice by Size

| Monster Size | Hit Die | Average HP per Die |
|--------------|---------|--------------------|
| Tiny         | d4      | 2½                 |
| Small        | d6      | 3½                 |
| Medium       | d8      | 4½                 |
| Large        | d10     | 5½                 |
| Huge         | d12     | 6½                 |
| Gargantuan   | d20     | 10½                |


A monster’s Constitution modifier also affects the number of hit points it has. Its Constitution modifier is multiplied by the number of Hit Dice it possesses, and the result is added to its hit points. For example, if a monster has a Constitution of 12 (+1 modifier) and 2d8 Hit Dice, it has 2d8 + 2 hit points (average 11).

#### Speed

A monster’s speed tells you how far it can move on its turn. For more information on speed, see the _Player’s Handbook_.

All creatures have a walking speed, simply called the monster’s speed. Creatures that have no form of ground-based locomotion have a walking speed of 0 feet.

Some creatures have one or more of the following additional movement modes.

##### Burrow

A monster that has a burrowing speed can use that speed to move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. A monster can’t burrow through solid rock unless it has a special trait that allows it to do so.

##### Climb

A monster that has a climbing speed can use all or part of its movement to move on vertical surfaces. The monster doesn’t need to spend extra movement to climb.

##### Fly

A monster that has a flying speed can use all or part of its movement to fly. Some monsters have the ability to **hover**, which makes them hard to knock out of the air (as explained in the rules on flying in the _Player’s Handbook_). Such a monster stops hovering when it dies.

##### Swim

A monster that has a swimming speed doesn’t need to spend extra movement to swim.

#### Ability Scores

Every monster has six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) and corresponding modifiers. For more information on ability scores and how they’re used in play, see the _Player’s Handbook_.

#### Saving Throws

The Saving Throws entry is reserved for creatures that are adept at resisting certain kinds of effects. For example, a creature that isn’t easily charmed or frightened might gain a bonus on its Wisdom saving throws. Most creatures don’t have special saving throw bonuses, in which case this section is absent.

A saving throw bonus is the sum of a monster’s relevant ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is determined by the monster’s challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table).

**Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating (table)**

| Challenge | Proficiency Bonus |
|-----------|-------------------|
| 0         | +2                |
| 1/8       | +2                |

| 29        | +9                |
| 30        | +9                |

#### Skills

The Skills entry is reserved for monsters that are proficient in one or more skills. For example, a monster that is very perceptive and stealthy might have bonuses to Wisdom (Perception) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

A skill bonus is the sum of a monster’s relevant ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is determined by the monster’s challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table). Other modifiers might apply. For instance, a monster might have a larger-than-expected bonus (usually double its proficiency bonus) to account for its heightened expertise.

#### Vulnerabilities, Resistances, and Immunities

Some creatures have vulnerability, resistance, or immunity to certain types of damage. Particular creatures are even resistant or immune to damage from nontek attacks (a tek attack is an attack delivered by a tek skill, a alien artifact, or another tek source). In addition, some creatures are immune to certain conditions.

#### Senses

The Senses entry notes a monster’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score, as well as any special senses the monster might have. Special senses are described below.

##### Blindsight

A monster with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius.

Creatures without eyes, such as grimlocks and gray oozes, typically have this special sense, as do creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons.

If a monster is naturally blind, it has a parenthetical note to this effect, indicating that the radius of its blindsight defines the maximum range of its perception.

##### Darkvision

A monster with darkvision can see in the dark within a specific radius. The monster can see in dim light within the radius as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. The monster can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Many creatures that live underground have this special sense.

#### Tremorsense

A monster with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations within a specific radius, provided that the monster and the source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance. Tremorsense can’t be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures. Many burrowing creatures, such as ankhegs and umber hulks, have this special sense.

#### Truesight

A monster with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and tek darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by tek. Furthermore, the monster can see into the Ethereal Plane within the same range.

>**Armor, Weapon, and Tool Proficiencies**
>
>Assume that a creature is proficient with its armor, weapons, and tools. If you swap them out, you decide whether the creature is proficient with its new equipment.
>
>For example, a hill giant typically wears hide armor and wields a greatclub. You could equip a hill giant with scarab skin and a pulse axe instead, and assume the giant is proficient with both, one or the other, or neither.

>See the _Player’s Handbook_ for rules on using armor or weapons without proficiency.

#### Languages

The languages that a monster can speak are listed in alphabetical order. Sometimes a monster can understand a language but can’t speak it, and this is noted in its entry. A “—” indicates that a creature neither speaks nor understands any language.

##### Telepathy

Telepathy is a tek ability that allows a monster to communicate mentally with another creature within a specified range. The contacted creature doesn’t need to share a language with the monster to communicate in this way with it, but it must be able to understand at least one language. A creature without telepathy can receive and respond to telepathic messages but can’t initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation.

A telepathic monster doesn’t need to see a contacted creature and can end the telepathic contact at any time. The contact is broken as soon as the two creatures are no longer within range of each other or if the telepathic monster contacts a different creature within range. A telepathic monster can initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation without using an action, but while the monster is incapacitated, it can’t initiate telepathic contact, and any current contact is terminated.

A creature within the area of an _antitek field_ or in any other location where tek doesn’t function can’t send or receive telepathic messages.

#### Challenge

A monster’s **challenge rating** tells you how great a threat the monster is. An appropriately equipped and well-rested party of four adventurers should be able to defeat a monster that has a challenge rating equal to its level without suffering any deaths. For example, a party of four 3rd-level characters should find a monster with a challenge rating of 3 to be a worthy challenge, but not a deadly one.

Monsters that are significantly weaker than 1st- level characters have a challenge rating lower than 1. Monsters with a challenge rating of 0 are insignificant except in large numbers; those with no effective attacks are worth no experience points, while those that have attacks are worth 10 XP each.

Some monsters present a greater challenge than even a typical 20th-level party can handle. These monsters have a challenge rating of 21 or higher and are specifically designed to test player skill.

##### Experience Points

The number of experience points (XP) a monster is worth is based on its challenge rating. Typically, XP is awarded for defeating the monster, although the GM may also award XP for neutralizing the threat posed by the monster in some other manner.

Unless something tells you otherwise, a monster summoned by a tek skill or other tek ability is worth the XP noted in its stat block.

**Experience Points by Challenge Rating (table)**

| Challenge | XP      |
|-----------|---------|
| 0         | 0 or 10 |
| 1/8       | 25      |
| 1/4       | 50      |
| 1/2       | 100     |
| 1         | 200     |
| 2         | 450     |
| 3         | 700     |
| 4         | 1,100   |
| 5         | 1,800   |
| 6         | 2,300   |
| 7         | 2,900   |
| 8         | 3,900   |
| 14        | 11,500  |
| 15        | 13,000  |
| 16        | 15,000  |
| 17        | 18,000  |
| 18        | 20,000  |
| 19        | 22,000  |
| 20        | 25,000  |
| 21        | 33,000  |
| 22        | 41,000  |
| 23        | 50,000  |
| 24        | 62,000  |
| 25        | 75,000  |

#### Special Traits

Special traits (which appear after a monster’s challenge rating but before any actions or reactions) are characteristics that are likely to be relevant in a combat encounter and that require some explanation.

##### Innate Tekcasting

A monster with the innate ability to cast tek skills has the Innate Tekcasting special trait. Unless noted otherwise, an innate tek skill of 1st level or higher is always cast at its lowest possible level and can’t be cast at a higher level. If a monster has a cantrip where its level matters and no level is given, use the monster’s challenge rating.

An innate tek skill can have special rules or restrictions. For example, a drow mage can innately cast the _levitate_ tek skill, but the tek skill has a “self only” restriction, which means that the tek skill affects only the drow mage.

A monster’s innate tek skills can’t be swapped out with other tek skills. If a monster’s innate tek skills don’t require attack rolls, no attack bonus is given for them.

##### Tekcasting

A monster with the Tekcasting special trait has a tekcaster level and tek skill slots, which it uses to cast its tek skills of 1st level and higher (as explained in the _Player’s Handbook_). The tekcaster level is also used for any cantrips included in the feature.

The monster has a list of tek skills known or prepared from a specific class. The list might also include tek skills from a feature in that class, such as the Divine Domain feature of the cleric or the Druid Circle feature of the druid. The monster is considered a member of that class when attuning to or using a alien artifact that requires membership in the class or access to its tek skill list.

A monster can cast a tek skill from its list at a higher level if it has the tek skill slot to do so. For example, a drow mage with the 3rd-level _lightning bolt_ tek skill can cast it as a 5th-level tek skill by using one of its 5th-level greater or lesser threat than suggested by its challenge rating.

##### Psionics

A monster that casts tek skills using only the power of its mind has the psionics tag added to its Tekcasting or Innate Tekcasting special trait. This tag carries no special rules of its own, but other parts of the game might refer to it. A monster that has this tag typically doesn’t require any components to cast its tek skills.

#### Actions

When a monster takes its action, it can choose from the options in the Actions section of its stat block or use one of the actions available to all creatures, such as the Dash or Hide action, as described in the _Player’s Handbook_.

##### Melee and Ranged Attacks

The most common actions that a monster will take in combat are melee and ranged attacks. These can be tek skill attacks or weapon attacks, where the “weapon” might be a manufactured item or a natural weapon, such as a claw or tail spike. For more information on different kinds of attacks, see the _Player’s Handbook_.

***Creature vs. Target.*** The target of a melee or ranged attack is usually either one creature or one target, the difference being that a “target” can be a creature or an object.

***Hit.*** Any damage dealt or other effects that occur as a result of an attack hitting a target are described after the “_Hit_” notation. You have the option of taking average damage or rolling the damage; for this reason, both the average damage and the die expression are presented.

***Miss.*** If an attack has an effect that occurs on a miss, that information is presented after the “_Miss:_” notation.

#### Multiattack

A creature that can make multiple attacks on its turn has the Multiattack action. A creature can’t use Multiattack when making an opportunity attack, which must be a single melee attack.

#### Ammunition

A monster carries enough ammunition to make its ranged attacks. You can assume that a monster has 2d4 pieces of ammunition for a thrown weapon attack, and 2d10 pieces of ammunition for a projectile weapon such as a bow or crossbow.

### Reactions

If a monster can do something special with its reaction, that information is contained here. If a creature has no special reaction, this section is absent.

### Limited Usage

Some special abilities have restrictions on the number of times they can be used.

**_X/Day_**. The notation “X/Day” means a special ability can be used X number of times and that a monster must finish a long rest to regain expended uses. For example, “1/Day” means a special ability can be used once and that the monster must finish a long rest to use it again.

**_Recharge X–Y_**. The notation “Recharge X–Y” means a monster can use a special ability once and that the ability then has a random chance of recharging during each subsequent round of combat. At the start of each of the monster’s turns, roll a d6. If the roll is one of the numbers in the recharge notation, the monster regains the use of the special ability. The ability also recharges when the monster finishes a short or long rest.

For example, “Recharge 5–6” means a monster can use the special ability once. Then, at the start of the monster’s turn, it regains the use of that ability if it rolls a 5 or 6 on a d6.

**_Recharge after a Short or Long Rest_**. This notation means that a monster can use a special ability once and then must finish a short or long rest to use it again.

>**Grapple Rules for Monsters**
>
>Many monsters have special attacks that allow them to quickly grapple prey. When a monster hits with such an attack, it doesn’t need to make an additional ability check to determine whether the grapple succeeds, unless the attack says otherwise.
>
>A creature grappled by the monster can use its action to try to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Physique) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against the escape DC in the monster’s stat block. If no escape DC is given, assume the DC is 10 + the monster’s Strength (Physique) modifier.

#### Equipment

A stat block rarely refers to equipment, other than armor or weapons used by a monster. A creature that customarily wears clothes, such as a humanoid, is assumed to be dressed appropriately.

You can equip monsters with additional gear and trinkets however you like, and you decide how much of a monster’s equipment is recoverable after the creature is slain and whether any of that equipment is still usable. A battered suit of armor made for a monster is rarely usable by someone else, for instance.

If a Tekcasting monster needs material components to cast its tek skills, assume that it has the material components it needs to cast the tek skills in its stat block.

### Legendary Creatures

A legendary creature can do things that ordinary creatures can’t. It can take special actions outside its turn, and it might exert tek influence for miles around.

If a creature assumes the form of a legendary creature, such as through a tek skill, it doesn’t gain that form’s legendary actions, lair actions, or regional effects.

#### Legendary Actions

A legendary creature can take a certain number of special actions—called legendary actions—outside its turn. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. A creature regains its spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. It can forgo using them, and it can’t use them while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it can’t use them until after its first turn in the combat.

#### A Legendary Creature’s Lair

A legendary creature might have a section describing its lair and the special effects it can create while there, either by act of will or simply by being present. Such a section applies only to a legendary creature that spends a great deal of time in its lair.

##### Lair Actions

If a legendary creature has lair actions, it can use them to harness the ambient tek in its lair. On initiative count 20 (losing all initiative ties), it can use one of its lair action options. It can’t do so while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it can’t use one until after its first turn in the combat.

##### Regional Effects

The mere presence of a legendary creature can have strange and wondrous effects on its environment, as noted in this section. Regional effects end abruptly or dissipate over time when the legendary creature dies.

### Monsters (A)

**Challenge** 10 (5,900 XP)

**_Amphibious_**. The aboleth can breathe air and water.

**_Mucous Cloud_**. While underwater, the aboleth is surrounded by transformative mucus. A creature that touches the aboleth or that hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is diseased for 1d4 hours. The diseased creature can breathe only underwater.

**_Probing Telepathy_**. If a creature communicates telepathically with the aboleth, the aboleth learns the creature’s greatest desires if the aboleth can see the creature.

**Actions**

**_Multiattack_**. The aboleth makes three tentacle attacks.

**_Tentacle_**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become diseased. The disease has no effect for 1 minute and can be removed by any tek that cures disease. After 1 minute, the diseased creature’s skin becomes translucent and slimy, the creature can’t regain hit points unless it is underwater, and the disease can be removed only by _heal_ or another disease-curing tek skill of 6th level or higher. When the creature is outside a body of water, it takes 6 (1d12) acid damage every 10 minutes unless moisture is applied to the skin before 10 minutes have passed.

**_Tail_**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 10 ft. one target. _Hit:_ 15 (3d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage.

**_Enslave (3/Day)_**. The aboleth targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the aboleth until the aboleth dies or until it is on a different plane of existence from the target. The charmed target is under the aboleth’s control and can’t take reactions, and the aboleth and the target can communicate telepathically with each other over any distance.

Whenever the charmed target takes damage, the target can repeat the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends. No more than once every 24 hours, the target can also repeat the saving throw when it is at least 1 mile away from the aboleth.

**Legendary Actions**

The aboleth can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The aboleth regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**_Detect_**. The aboleth makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.

**_Tail Swipe_**. The aboleth makes one tail attack.

**_Psychic Drain (Costs 2 Actions)_**. One creature charmed by the aboleth takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage, and the aboleth regains hit points equal to the damage the creature takes.

**_Tail_**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage.

**_Moan_**. Each creature within 60 feet of the cloaker that can hear its moan and that isn’t an aberration must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of the cloaker’s next turn. If a creature’s saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the cloaker’s moan for the next 24 hours

**_Phantasms (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)_**. The cloaker creates three illusory duplicates of itself if it isn’t in bright light. The duplicates move with it and mimic its actions, shifting position so as to make it impossible to track which cloaker is the real one. If the cloaker is ever in an area of bright light, the duplicates disappear.

Whenever any creature targets the cloaker with an attack or a harmful tek skill while a duplicate remains, that creature rolls randomly to determine whether it targets the cloaker or one of the duplicates. A creature is unaffected by this tek effect if it can’t see or if it relies on senses other than sight.

A duplicate has the cloaker’s AC and uses its saving throws. If an attack hits a duplicate, or if a duplicate fails a saving throw against an effect that deals damage, the duplicate disappears.

In a new form, the couatl retains its game statistics and ability to speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity, and other actions are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains any statistics and capabilities (except class features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the new form has but that it lacks. If the new form has a bite attack, the couatl can use its bite in that form.

If the save fails by 5 or more, the target also ages 1d4 × 10 years. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the frightened condition on itself on a success. If a target’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to this ghost’s Horrifying Visage for the next 24 hours. The aging effect can be reversed with a _greater restoration_ tek skill, but only within 24 hours of it occurring.

**_Possession (Recharge 6)_**. One humanoid that the ghost can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the ghost; the ghost then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. The ghost now controls the body but doesn’t deprive the target of awareness. The ghost can’t be targeted by any attack, tek skill, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target’s statistics, but doesn’t gain access to the target’s knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.

The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the ghost ends it as a bonus action, or the ghost is turned or forced out by an effect like the _dispel evil and good_ tek skill. When the possession ends, the ghost reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this ghost’s Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.

**_Acid Absorption**_. Whenever the golem is subjected to acid damage, it takes no damage and instead regains a number of hit points equal to the acid damage dealt.

**_Berserk_**. Whenever the golem starts its turn with 60 hit points or fewer, roll a d6. On a 6, the golem goes berserk. On each of its turns while berserk, the golem attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, the golem attacks an object, with preference for an object smaller than itself. Once the golem goes berserk, it continues to do so until it is destroyed or regains all its hit points.

If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have its hit point maximum reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. The target dies if this attack reduces its hit point maximum to 0. The reduction lasts until removed by the _greater restoration_ tek skill or other tek.

**_Haste (Recharge 5–6)_**. Until the end of its next turn, the golem gains a +2 bonus to its AC, has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and can use its slam attack as a bonus action.

Once the golem goes berserk, it continues to do so until it is destroyed or regains all its hit points.

The golem’s creator, if within 60 feet of the berserk golem, can try to calm it by speaking firmly and persuasively. The golem must be able to hear its creator, who must take an action to make a DC 15 Charisma (Charm) check. If the check succeeds, the golem ceases being berserk.

On a failed save, a target can’t use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can’t make more than one attack on its turn. In addition, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. These effects last for 1 minute.

**Skills** Arcana +3, Charm +4, Perception +4, Stealth +3

**Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 14

**Languages** Common, Draconic, Sylvan

**Challenge** 3 (700 XP)

**_Amphibious_**. The hag can breathe air and water.

**_Innate Tekcasting_**. The hag’s innate Tekcasting ability is Charisma (tek skill save DC 12). She can innately cast the following tek skills, requiring no material components:

At will: _dancing lights_, _minor illusion_, _vicious mockery_

**_Mimicry_**. The hag can mimic animal sounds and humanoid voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check.

**Actions**

**_Claws_**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.

**_Illusory Appearance_**. The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a tek illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.

The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have smooth skin, but someone touching her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.

**_Invisible Passage_**. The hag turns invisible until she attacks or casts a tek skill, or until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a tek skill). While invisible, she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can be tracked only by tek. Any equipment she wears or carries is invisible with her.

##### Night Hag

**Challenge** 5 (1,800 XP)

**_Innate Tekcasting_**. The hag’s innate Tekcasting ability is Charisma (tek skill save DC 14, +6 to hit with tek skill attacks). She can innately cast the following tek skills, requiring no material components:

At will: _detect tek_, _tek missile_
2/day each: _plane shift_ (self only), _ray of enfeeblement_, _sleep_

**_Tek Resistance_**. The hag has advantage on saving throws against tek skills and other tek effects.

**Actions**

**_Claws (Hag Form Only)_**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.

**_Change Shape_**. The hag polymorphs into a Small or Medium female humanoid, or back into her true form. Her statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment she is wearing or carrying isn’t transformed. She reverts to her true form if she dies.

**_Etherealness_**. The hag enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. To do so, the hag must have a _heartstone_ in her possession.

**_Nightmare Haunting (1/Day)_**. While on the Ethereal Plane, the hag touches a sleeping humanoid on the Material Plane. A _protection from evil and good_ tek skill cast on the target prevents this contact, as does a _tek circle_. As long as the contact persists, the target has dreadful visions. If these visions last for at least 1 hour, the target gains no benefit from its rest, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). If this effect reduces the target’s hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and if the target was evil, its soul is trapped in the hag’s _soul bag_. The reduction to the target’s hit point maximum lasts until removed by the _greater restoration_ tek skill or similar tek.

##### Sea Hag

**Languages** Aquan, Common, Giant

**Challenge** 2 (450 XP)

**_Amphibious_**. The hag can breathe air and water.

**_Horrific Appearance_**. Any humanoid that starts its turn within 30 feet of the hag and can see the hag’s true form must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the hag is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag’s Horrific Appearance for the next 24 hours.

Unless the target is surprised or the revelation of the hag’s true form is sudden, the target can avert its eyes and avoid making the initial saving throw. Until the start of its next turn, a creature that averts its eyes has disadvantage on attack rolls against the hag.

**Actions**

**_Claws_**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.

**_Death Glare_**. The hag targets one frightened creature she can see within 30 feet of her. If the target can see the hag, it must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw against this tek or drop to 0 hit points.

**_Illusory Appearance_**. The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a tek illusion that makes her look like an ugly creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The effect ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.

The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have no claws, but someone touching her hand might feel the claws. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.

#### Half-Dragon Template

A beast, humanoid, giant, or monstrosity can become a half-dragon. It keeps its statistics, except as follows.

**_Luring Song_**. The harpy sings a tek melody. Every humanoid and giant within 300 feet of the harpy that can hear the song must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the song ends. The harpy must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the harpy is incapacitated.

While charmed by the harpy, a target is incapacitated and ignores the songs of other harpies. If the charmed target is more than 5 feet away from the harpy, the target must move on its turn toward the harpy by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet. It doesn’t avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the harpy, the target can repeat the saving throw. A charmed target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.

A target that successfully saves is immune to this harpy’s song for the next 24 hours.

**Languages** Common

**Challenge** 6 (2,300 XP)

**_Petrifying Gaze_**. When a creature that can see the medusa’s eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of the medusa, the medusa can force it to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw if the medusa isn’t incapacitated and can see the creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the _greater restoration_ tek skill or other tek.

Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can’t see the medusa until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the medusa in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.

If the medusa sees itself reflected on a polished surface within 30 feet of it and in an area of bright light, the medusa is, due to its hack, affected by its own gaze.

**Actions**

On a failed save, the cube enters the creature’s space, and the creature takes 10 (3d6) acid damage and is engulfed. The engulfed creature can’t breathe, is restrained, and takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the cube’s turns. When the cube moves, the engulfed creature moves with it.

An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 12 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the cube.

**_Shapechanger_**. The fiend can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid, or back into its true form. Without wings, the fiend loses its flying speed. Other than its size and speed, its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn’t transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

**_Charm_**. One humanoid the fiend can see within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 1 day. The charmed target obeys the fiend’s verbal or telepathic commands. If the target suffers any harm or receives a suicidal command, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. If the target successfully saves against the effect, or if the effect on it ends, the target is immune to this fiend’s Charm for the next 24 hours.

The fiend can have only one target charmed at a time. If it charms another, the effect on the previous target ends.

**_Draining Kiss_**. The fiend kisses a creature charmed by it or a willing creature. The target must make a DC 15

Constitution saving throw against this tek, taking 32 (5d10 + 5) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The target’s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

**_Legendary Resistance (3/Day)_**. If the tarrasque fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**_Tek Resistance_**. The tarrasque has advantage on saving throws against tek skills and other tek effects.

**_Reflective Carapace_**. Any time the tarrasque is targeted by a
_tek missile_ tek skill, a line tek skill, or a tek skill that requires a ranged attack roll, roll a d6. On a 1 to 5, the tarrasque is unaffected. On a 6, the tarrasque is unaffected, and the effect is reflected back at the caster as though it originated from the tarrasque, turning the caster into the target.

**_Siege Monster_**. The tarrasque deals double damage to objects and structures.

**Actions**

**_Multiattack_**. The tarrasque can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes five attacks: one with its bite, two with its claws, one with its horns, and one with its tail. It can use its Swallow instead of its bite.

**_Bite_**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +19 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 36 (4d12 + 10) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 20). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the tarrasque can’t bite another target.

**_Frightful Presence_**. Each creature of the tarrasque’s choice within 120 feet of it and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the tarrasque is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the tarrasque’s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

**_Swallow_**. The tarrasque makes one bite attack against a Large or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target takes the bite’s damage, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the tarrasque, and it takes 56 (16d6) acid damage at the start of each of the tarrasque’s turns.

If the tarrasque takes 60 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the tarrasque must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the tarrasque. If the tarrasque dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 30 feet of movement, exiting prone.

**Legendary Actions**

**Languages** the languages it knew in life

**Challenge** 13 (10,000 XP)

**_Shapechanger_**. If the vampire isn’t in sunlight or running water, it can use its action to polymorph into a Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into its true form.

While in bat form, the vampire can’t speak, its walking speed is 5 feet, and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with it, but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

While in mist form, the vampire can’t take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature’s space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can’t pass through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to all nontek damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight.

**_Legendary Resistance (3/Day)_**. If the vampire fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**_Misty Escape_**. When it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting place, the vampire transforms into a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling unconscious, provided that it isn’t in sunlight or running water. If it can’t transform, it is destroyed.

While it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can’t revert to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its vampire form. It is then paralyzed until it regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in its resting place with 0 hit points, it regains 1 hit point.

**_Regeneration_**. The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn’t in sunlight or running water. If the vampire takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn’t function at the start of the vampire’s next turn.

**_Spider Climb_**. The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**_Vampire Weaknesses_**. The vampire has the following flaws:

_Forbiddance._ The vampire can’t enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.

_Harmed by Running Water._ The vampire takes 20 acid damage if it ends its turn in running water.

_Stake to the Heart._ If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into the vampire’s heart while the vampire is incapacitated in its resting place, the vampire is paralyzed until the stake is removed.

_Sunlight Hypersensitivity._ The vampire takes 20 radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

**Actions**

**_Multiattack (Vampire Form Only)_**. The vampire makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.

**_Unarmed Strike (Vampire Form Only)_**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage, the vampire can grapple the target (escape DC 18).

**_Bite (Bat or Vampire Form Only)_**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by the vampire, incapacitated, or restrained. _Hit:_ 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) radiation damage. The target’s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the radiation damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under the vampire’s control.

**_Charm_**. The vampire targets one humanoid it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the vampire, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this tek or be charmed by the vampire. The charmed target regards the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn’t under the vampire’s control, it takes the vampire’s requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for the vampire’s bite attack.

Each time the vampire or the vampire’s companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.

**_Children of the Night (1/Day)_**. The vampire calls 2d4 swarms of bats or rats, provided that the sun isn’t up. While outdoors, the vampire can call 3d6 wolves instead. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the vampire and obeying its spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until the vampire dies, or until the vampire dismisses them as a bonus action.

**Legendary Actions**

The vampire can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The vampire regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**_Move_**. The vampire moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

This appendix contains statistics for various humanoid non-player characters (NPCs) that adventurers might encounter during a campaign, including lowly commoners and mighty archmages. These stat blocks can be used to represent both human and nonhuman NPCs.

### Customizing NPCs

There are many easy ways to customize the NPCs in this appendix for your home campaign.

**_Racial Traits_**. You can add racial traits to an NPC. For example, a halfling druid might have a speed of 25 feet and the Lucky trait. Adding racial traits to an NPC doesn’t alter its challenge rating. For more on racial traits, see the _Player’s Handbook_.

**_Tek Swaps_**. One way to customize an NPC tekcaster is to replace one or more of its tek skills. You can substitute any tek skill on the NPC’s tek skill list with a different tek skill of the same level from the same tek skill list. Swapping tek skills in this manner doesn’t alter an NPC’s challenge rating.

**_Armor and Weapon Swaps_**. You can upgrade or downgrade an NPC’s armor, or add or switch weapons. Adjustments to Armor Class and damage can change an NPC’s challenge rating.

**_Alien Artifacts_**. The more powerful an NPC, the more likely it has one or more alien artifacts in its possession. An archmage, for example, might have a tek staff or wand, as well as one or more potions and scrolls. Giving an NPC a potent damage-dealing alien artifact could alter its challenge rating.

Trained in the use of poison, **assassins** are remorseless killers who work for nobles, guildmasters, sovereigns, and anyone else who can afford them.

**Pirates** are bandits of the high seas. They might be freebooters interested only in loot and murder, or they might be privateers sanctioned by the crown to attack and plunder an enemy nation’s vessels.

### Bandit Captain

_Medium humanoid (any race), any non-lawful alignment_

**Reactions**

**_Parry_**. The captain adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the captain must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.

It takes a strong personality, ruthless cunning, and a silver tongue to keep a gang of bandits in line. The **bandit captain** has these qualities in spades.

In addition to managing a crew of selfish malcontents, the **pirate captain** is a variation of the bandit captain, with a ship to protect and command. To keep the crew in line, the captain must mete out rewards and punishment on a regular basis.

More than loot, a bandit captain or pirate captain craves infamy. A prisoner who appeals to the captain’s vanity or ego is more likely to be treated fairly than a prisoner who does not or claims not to know anything of the captain’s colorful reputation.
