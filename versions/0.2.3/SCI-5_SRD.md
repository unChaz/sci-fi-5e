# The Cryo-Emergent Handbook

## Introduction

Welcome to your new life! The Sol Commerce Authority (SCA) is responsible for reorienting all preserved Natural Humans into this new world.

Centuries ago it was common practice for terminally ill humans, or those with vast resources to facilitate the cryogenic preservation of their bodies to be revived when scientific advancement allowed.

SCA legislation HL-3404-C53 dictates that all cryogenically preserved pre-stack natural humans that have not been revived to be confiscated by the SCA. Your consciousness has been legally conscripted into indentured servitude to the SCA until you have paid off your contract.

You were not revived for one of the following reasons:

- Your sleeve was damaged and unsuitable to be revived.
- Your cryo insurance coverage was not comprehensive enough to cover the cost of sleeve repair.
- Your cryo insurance agency was waiting for your sleeve repair costs to become lower.
- The contract on your revival designated a date after HL-3404-C53 went into effect.

## Persona

SCA assesses each emergent for personality traits. Scores are given to each trait at a 1:1 ratio. Scores range between -2 and 4.

Personality traits were the results of a two decades long psychological study at the Ganymede Institute. These traits were determined to be the most core quantification of the natural human personality. These traits are completely independent of physical form, and represent the human mind.

| Trait | Description|
|:----:|:-------------|
| Wit  | Mental sharpness and inventiveness; keen intelligence. |
| Will  | Mental fortitude. This is the mind’s ability to resist tek effectrs, and mental stress. |
| Intelligence | The ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills. |
| Wisdom | The soundness of an action or decision with regard to the application of experience, knowledge, and good judgment. |

> ### Calculating Ability Scores
> Each ability score is calculated by rolling 3d4, dropping the lowest, and subtracting 4 from the result.

```
```

## Sleeve

Thanks to modern cloning techniques, and the availability of confiscated human bodies, death no longer needs to be permanent.

Upon death, if your stack is recovered, you can purchase a new sleeve, or be provided one in the case of wrongful death, or if you are properly insured.

### Quality Control
All sleeves must be appraised by the **Board of Quality Control** to ensure buyer protection. Sleeves are appraised with the following traits:


| Trait | Description |
|:----:|:-------------|
|Strength |Physical strength |
|Dexterity | Agility, reflex, and balance |
|Charisma | Beauty, appearance |
|Constitution | Overall health |


## Skills
Average skill levels can be derived from these core Sleeve Traits, and Persona Traits to give you a better idea of the effectiveness of a sleeve. Each skill is a combination of 2 traits.

##### Skill Definition
| Skill | Trait Combinations |
|:----:|:-------------|
|Physique | Strength + Constitution |
|Acrobatics | Strength + Dexterity |
|Toughness | Constitution + Will |
|Intimidation | Strength + Wit |
|Medic | Will + Wisdom|
|Charm | Wit + Charisma|
|Stealth | Dexterity + Will|
|Perception | Wisdom + Wit|
|Computers | Wit + Intelligence|
|Performance | Dexterity + Charisma|
|Tinker | Dexterity + Intelligence|
|Piloting | Dexterity + Intelligence|
|History | Wisdom + Intelligence |
|Trickery | Dexterity + Wit|
|Investigation | Will + Intelligence|
|Insight | Charisma + Wisdom |
|Diplomacy | Intelligence + Charisma |
|Nature | Wisdom + Will |

\page

### Skill Difficulty
In order to be successful at the given task, you roll the die, and add your skill score to the number you rolled. If the number is equal or higher than the difficulty score of the task, you were successful.

| Difficulty | Minimum Rolls |
|:----:|:-------------|
|Very Easy|10|
|Easy|15|
|Medium|20|
|Hard|25|
|Very Hard|30|
|Nearly Impossible|35|

The person determining the difficulty might increment the number on the table based on environmental conditions that might make the task easier or more difficult.

## Tekcasting
 Major advancements in technology have enabled the use of seemingly supernatural powers. Some humans have the ability to use tekcasters, devices discovered from a derelict alien spacestation.

### Focus
The focus used by those casting tek skills is called a Tekcaster. The tekcaster is a device worn on the wrist and is connected to the fingers. Using a combination of hand movements, vocal commands, and material components, the tekcaster can be used to cast tek skills. One can wield a weapon while wearing a tekcaster, but the hand must be free to use it.

> ##### The two sources of Tek Skill
> #### History
> One method to cast tek skills is to learn how to use them. This often involves lots of studying and  memorization. Using this method, the sleeve you are in does not impact how effective you are at casting tek skills.
>
> Classes that use this type of tek are Priest , Morph, Scout, Cybernetic, and Arcanist.
>
> #### Genetic Alteration
> Another way to cast tek skills is to be genetically modified to do so. This prevents you from having to memorize tek skills, but you must be equipped with an adequate sleeve that has been genetically modified.
>
> Usually sleeves with above average Charisma or Constitution are better suited to this type of casting.
>
> Classes that use this type of tek are Evangelists, Guardians, and Scions.


```
```

### Willpower
Regardless of the method of tek casting, Willpower is always at the core of casting tek skills. When estimating a caster’s tek ability, you add the relevant ability score to your Will score to determine your Tekcasting power. The only exception is Evangelist, which uses their Wit and Charisma score since their tek is a form of performance.

Sleeve Market
All tier 1 quality sleeves are given basic genetic alterations. You merely need to specify which basic genetic alteration you desire, and a limited set of sleeves is presented for you to choose from.

Basic Genetic Alterations
(Free Upgrades)

Innate Tekcasting

Genetic Enhancements
(Premium Upgrades)

Enhanced Muscle Memory: +1 PHY
Thick Skinned: +1 CON
Integrated Synapses: +1 DEX
Curated Aesthetics: +1 CHA

Basic sleeve insurance does not cover genetic enhancements. You can upgrade for a cost to a maximum of +2 per trait.

|  Upgrades | Cost |
|:----:|:-------------|
|1| 50,000c|
|2| 90,000c|
|3| 130,000c|
|4| 160,000c|

Upgrades can be retained when transferring to a new sleeve, or a return of 80% of the upgrade cost will be returned to you.

## Feats
At every 4 stack levels the Board of Quality Control awards employees with a free stack or sleeve upgrade. These upgrades come in a form of a predefined “feat” or a genetic alteration or stack data upload.
A list of available feats can be provided upon request.

Alternatively, you can be awarded 2 points to be allocated towards a genetic sleeve upgrade, or a data upload to your stack.

### Genetic Upgrade Option
Based on the type of genetic alteration (Physique, Constitution, Dexterity, Charisma), you will either be issued a new similar sleeve, or given genetic enhancements to your current sleeve. You may be given the option to choose.

### Data Upload Option
One unit of data uploaded to your stack will be guaranteed to be enough to increase your Wit, Will, Intelligence or Wisdom assessment score by 1 point.

<!-- Classes -->
<!-- TODO -->

<!-- Backgrounds -->
```
```
### Backgrounds

Every story has a beginning. Your character’s background reveals where you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the world. Your soldier might have been a courageous knight or a grizzled soldier. Your Arcanist could have been a sage or an artisan. Your scoundrel might have gotten by as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a jester.

Choosing a background provides you with important story cues about your character’s identity. The most important question to ask about your background is *what changed*? Why did you stop doing whatever your background describes and start adventuring? Where did you get the money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why don’t you have *more* money? How did you learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share your background?

The sample backgrounds in this chapter provide both concrete benefits (features, proficiencies, and languages) and roleplaying suggestions.

##### Proficiencies

Each background gives a character proficiency in two skills (described in “Using Ability Scores”).

In addition, most backgrounds give a character proficiency with one or more tools (detailed in “Equipment”).

If a character would gain the same proficiency from two different sources, he or she can choose a different proficiency of the same kind (skill or tool) instead.

##### Languages

Some backgrounds also allow characters to learn additional languages beyond those given by race. See “Languages.”

##### Equipment

Each background provides a package of starting equipment. If you use the optional rule to spend coin on gear, you do not receive the starting equipment from your background.

##### Suggested Characteristics

A background contains suggested personal characteristics based on your background. You can pick characteristics, roll dice to determine them randomly, or use the suggestions as inspiration for characteristics of your own creation.

##### Customizing a Background

You might want to tweak some of the features of a background so it better fits your character or the campaign setting. To customize a background, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose any two skills, and choose a total of two tool proficiencies or languages from the sample backgrounds. You can either use the equipment package from your background or spend coin on gear as described in the equipment section. (If you spend coin, you can’t also take the equipment package suggested for your class.) Finally, choose two personality traits, one ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you can’t find a feature that matches your desired background, work with your GM to create one.

The business venture can be anything legal or illegal. You must fund the venture directly by investing credits and making the appropriate business connections. The success of the venture is determined by a number of appropriate ability checks determined by the DM. Results can range from capital gains/losses, earned/ruined business relationships, to even legal trouble, or disputes with elite houses/corporations. Once you make the proposal and appropriate connections, the length of the business venture, the difficulty, and potential outcomes will be determined by the DM.

<!-- Multiclassing -->
\page
### Multiclassing

Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options.

With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining a level in your current class. Your levels in all your classes are added together to determine your character level. For example, if you have three levels in Arcanist and two in soldier, you’re a 5th-level character.

As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of your original class with just a few levels in another class, or you might change course entirely, never looking back at the class you left behind. You might even start progressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to a single-class character of the same level, you’ll sacrifice some focus in exchange for versatility.

#### Prerequisites

To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your new one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For example, a brute who decides to multiclass into the morph class must have both Strength and Wisdom scores of 13 or higher. Without the full training that a beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in your new class, having a natural aptitude that is reflected by higher- than-average ability scores.

**Multiclassing Prerequisites (table)**

| Class     | Ability Score Minimum       |
|-----------|-----------------------------|
| Brute | Strength 3                 |
| Evangelist      | Charisma 3                 |
| Priest    | Wisdom 3                   |
| Morph     | Wisdom 3                   |
| Soldier   | Strength 3 or Dexterity 3 |
| Monk      | Dexterity 3 and Wisdom 3  |
| Guardian   | Strength 3 and Charisma 3 |
| Scout    | Dexterity 3 and Wisdom 3  |
| Scoundrel     | Dexterity 3                |
| Scion  | Charisma 3                 |
| Cybernetic   | Charisma 3                 |
| Arcanist    | Intelligence 3             |

#### Experience Points

The experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table, not your level in a particular class. So, if you are a priest 6/soldier 1, you must gain enough XP to reach 8th level before you can take your second level as a soldier or your seventh level as a priest.

#### Hit Points and Hit Dice

You gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a class only when you are a 1st-level character.

You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can simply pool them together. For example, both the soldier and the guardian have a d10, so if you are a guardian 5/soldier 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them separately. If you are a guardian 5/priest 5, for example, you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d8 Hit Dice.

### Proficiency Bonus

Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table in chapter 1, not your level in a particular class. For example, if you are a soldier 3/scoundrel 2, you have the proficiency bonus of a 5th- level character, which is +3.

### Proficiencies

When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of new class’s starting proficiencies, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.

**Multiclassing Proficiencies (table)**

| Class     | Proficiencies Gained                                                                                       |

| Morph     | Light armor, medium armor (morphs will not wear armor)             |
| Soldier   | Light armor, medium armor, pulse shields, simple weapons, martial weapons                                        |
| Monk      | Simple weapons, ion blades                                                                                |

| Scion  | —                                                                                                          |
| Cybernetic   | Light armor, simple weapons                                                                                |
| Arcanist    | —                                                                                                          |

#### Class Features

When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don’t, however, receive the class’s starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you’re multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Tekcasting.

\page

##### Channel Divinity

If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn’t give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a priest 6/guardian 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the priest class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.

##### Extra Attack

If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don’t add together. You can’t make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the soldier’s version of Extra Attack does). Similarly, the cybernetic’s nanotech invocation Thirsting Blade doesn’t give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.

##### Unarmored Defense

If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can’t gain it again from another class.

##### Tekcasting

Your capacity for Tekcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your Tekcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Tekcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Tekcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

**_Tek Skills Known and Prepared._** You determine what tek skills you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a scout 4/Arcanist 3, for example, you know three 1st-level scout tek skills based on your levels in the scout class. As 3rd-level Arcanist, you know three Arcanist cantrips, and your tek skill datapad contains ten Arcanist tek skills, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as an arcanist) can be 2nd-level tek skills. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six Arcanist tek skills from your tek skill datapad.

Each tek skill you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the Tekcasting ability of that class when you cast the tek skill. Similarly, a Tekcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the tek skills from the class associated with that focus.

**_Tek Slots._** You determine your available tek skill slots by adding together all your levels in the evangelist, priest, morph, scion, and Arcanist classes, and half your levels (rounded down) in the guardian and scout classes. Use this total to determine your tek skill slots by consulting the Multiclass Tekcaster table.

If you have more than one Tekcasting class, this table might give you tek skill slots of a level that is higher than the tek skills you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level tek skills. If a lower-level tek skill that you cast, like _burning hands_, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don’t have any tek skills of that higher level.

For example, if you are the aforementioned scout 4/Arcanist 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your tek skill slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don’t know any 3rd-level tek skills, nor do you know any 2nd-level scout tek skills. You can use the tek skill slots of those levels to cast the tek skills you do know—and potentially enhance their effects.

**_Link Tek._** If you have both the Tekcasting class feature and the Link Tek class feature from the cybernetic class, you can use the tek skill slots you gain from the Link Tek feature to cast tek skills you know or have prepared from classes with the Tekcasting class feature, and you can use the tek skill slots you gain from the Tekcasting class feature to cast cybernetic tek skills you know.

<!-- Leveling Up -->
\page
## Beyond 1st Level

---

<div class="wide">
As your character goes on adventures and overcomes challenges, he or she gains experience, represented by experience points. A character who reaches a specified experience point total advances in capability. This advancement is called **gaining a level**.

When your character gains a level, his or her class often grants additional features, as detailed in the class description. Some of these features allow you to increase your ability scores, either increasing two scores by 1 each or increasing one score by 2. You can’t increase an ability score above 20. In addition, every character’s proficiency bonus increases at certain levels.

Each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die. Roll that Hit Die, add your Constitution modifier to the roll, and add the total to your hit point maximum. Alternatively, you can use the fixed value shown in your class entry, which is the average result of the die roll (rounded up).

When your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained. For example, if your 7th-level soldier has a Constitution score of 18, when he reaches 8th level, he increases his Constitution score from 17 to 18, thus increasing his Constitution modifier from +3 to +4. His hit point maximum then increases by 8.

The Character Advancement table summarizes the XP you need to advance in levels from level 1 through level 20, and the proficiency bonus for a character of that level. Consult the information in your character’s class description to see what other improvements you gain at each level.

## Character Advancement

## Equipment
---

Currency is mostly dealt with in digital credits, however coins are still in circulation.

With one 100 credits, a character can buy a bedroll, 50 carbon fiber rope, or a low end datapad. A skilled (but not exceptional) worker can earn 100 credits a day.

50 credits buys a laborer’s work for half a day, a night in a low end hostel, or a few rounds of drinks at a pub.

A single credit buys a pack of gum, small flashlight, or a bottle of water.

Coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.

**Standard Exchange Rates (table)**

| Coin          | Credits |
|---------------|-------|
| Copper (cp)   | 1     |
| Silver (sp)   | 10    |
| Gold (gp)     | 100   |
| Platinum (pp) | 1,000 |

### Selling Loot

Opportunities abound to find loot, equipment, weapons, armor, and more in the dungeons you explore. Normally, you can sell your loot and trinkets when you return to a town or other colony, provided that you can find buyers and merchants interested in your loot.

**_Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment._** As a general rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch half their cost when sold in a market. Weapons and armor used by raiders are rarely in good enough condition to sell.

**_Alien Artifacts._** Selling alien artifacts is problematic. Finding someone to buy a potion or a datacube isn’t too hard, but other items are out of the realm of most but the wealthiest nobles. Likewise, aside from a few common alien artifacts, you won’t normally come across alien artifacts or tek skills to purchase. The value of tek is far beyond simple gold and should always be treated as such.

**_Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects._** These items retain their full value in the marketplace, and you can either trade them in for coin or use them as currency for other transactions. For exceptionally valuable loot, the GM might require you to find a buyer in a large town or larger community first.

**_Trade Goods._** In the black abyss, many people conduct transactions through barter. Like gems and art objects, trade rare minerals, water, livestock, and so on—retain their full value in the market and can be used as currency.

<!-- Armor -->
\page
### Armor

Fantasy gaming worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many different cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from Flak armor to scarab skin to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and separates them into three categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor with A Pulse Shields.

The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor worn in futuristic gaming worlds.

**_Armor Proficiency._** Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap A Pulse Shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor’s use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can’t cast tek skills.

**_Armor Class (AC)._** Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class.

**_Heavy Armor._** Heavier armor interferes with the wearer’s ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows “Str 13” or “Str 15” in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the wearer’s speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.

**_Stealth._** If the Armor table shows “Disadvantage” in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

**_Pulse Shields._** A Pulse Shields is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding A Pulse Shields increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.

#### Light Armor

Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.

**_flak armor._** Lightweight metal lined combat armor.

**_pulse armor._** Powered by a small generator, this expensive shielding deflects projectiles. Once depleted it takes time to recharge. Pulse armor can be quite expensive, but ideal if you are trying to keep a low profile.

#### Medium Armor

Medium armor offers more protection than light armor, but it also impairs movement more. If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.

**_scarab skin._** Made of interlocking metal rings, a scarab skin is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This armor offers modest protection to the wearer’s upper body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against one another to be muffled by outer layers.

**_kevlar._** Basic military issue combat armor.

#### Heavy Armor

Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk.

Heavy armor doesn’t let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn’t penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative.

**_Power Shell._** Heavy and cumbersome, this powered mech armor gives the wearer enhanced strength, and a tough shell more resistant to damage than the standard pulse armor. However it makes it very difficult to be stealthy. This armor gives the wearer +2 Strength.

#### Getting Into and Out of Armor

The time it takes to don or doff armor depends on the armor’s category.

**_Don._** This is the time it takes to put on armor. You benefit from the armor’s AC only if you take the full time to don the suit of armor.

**_Doff._** This is the time it takes to take off armor. If you have help, reduce this time by half.

### Weapons

Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class’s focus and the tools you are most likely to use. Whether you favor a pulse blade or a rail rifle, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring.

The Weapons table shows the most common weapons used in the futuristic gaming worlds, their price and weight, the damage they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. Every weapon is classified as either melee or ranged. A **melee weapon** is used to attack a target within 5 feet of you, whereas a **ranged weapon** is used to attack a target at a distance.

#### Weapon Proficiency

Your race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The two categories are **simple** and **martial**. Most people can use simple weapons with proficiency. These weapons include clubs, maces, and other weapons often found in the hands of commoners. Martial weapons, including swords and axes, require more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial weapons because these weapons put their fighting style and training to best use.

Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.

## Weapon Types

### Ion Weapons

Straight bladed weapons forged with modern day technology are much stronger than the steel blades once used on Earth. Their molecular structure makes them better for getting through weaker pulse armor.

### Pulse Weapons

Powered melee weapons designed to puncture through modern armor.

#### Weapon Properties

Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.

**_Ammunition._** You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Once your clip runs out of ammunition, you have to spend an action to reload.

If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see “Improvised Weapons” later in the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

**_Finesse._** When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

**_Heavy._** Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon’s size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively. Light. A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

**_Burst-Fire._** Weapons with this trait fire multiple rounds of ammunition per round. You roll once to hit, but roll damage separately for each round of ammunition.

**_Loading._** Weapons with this trait need to be reloaded after firing a certain number of times. For example a Rail Rifle fires 3 rounds of ammunition per round, and requires to be reloaded every 10 shots, meaning its clips hold 30 rounds of ammunition.

**_Range._** A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon’s long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can’t attack a target beyond the weapon’s long range.

**_Reach._** This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

**_Special._** A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon’s description (see “Special Weapons” later in this section).

**_Thrown._** If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw an ion dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the ion dagger has the finesse property.

**_Two-Handed._** This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

**_Versatile._** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

**_Hidden._** This weapon can be disguised as an ordinary object with a Stealth check. It takes a bonus action to unsheathe.

##### Improvised Weapons

Sometimes characters don’t have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead goblin.

Often, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the GM’s option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.

An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the GM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.

\page

##### Special Weapons

Weapons with special rules are described here.

**_Razer._** This weapon can be toggled between whip form and rapier form using a bonus action. As a rapier it is a Finesse weapon that does 1d8 piercing. As a whip it has Reach, and does 1d4 slashing.

**_Pulse Fist._** Has advantage on targets using Pulse Shielding.

**_Pulse Net._** A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 concussive damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net.

When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

### Adventuring Gear

This section describes items that have special rules or require further explanation.

**_Grenade._** Throw at a location within 30 feet. Creatures within 5 feet must make a dexterity 14 saving throw or take damage based on the grenade's type. Types: Incendiary, Radiation, Cryo,

**_Antitoxin._** A creature that drinks this vial of liquid gains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to undead or constructs.

**_Book._** A book might contain poetry, historical accounts, information pertaining to a particular field of lore, diagrams and notes on gnomish contraptions, or just about anything else that can be represented using text or pictures. A book of tek skills is a tek skill datapad (described later in this section).

**_Caltrops._** As an action, you can spread a bag of caltrops to cover a square area that is 5 feet on a side. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving this turn and take 1 piercing damage. Taking this damage reduces the creature’s walking speed by 10 feet until the creature regains at least 1 hit point. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn’t need to make the save.

**_Chain._** A chain has 10 hit points. It can be burst with a successful DC 20 Strength check.

**_Climber’s Kit._** A climber’s kit includes special pitons, boot tips, gloves, and a harness. You can use the climber’s kit as an action to anchor yourself; when you do, you can’t fall more than 25 feet from the point where you anchored yourself, and you can’t climb more than 25 feet away from that point without undoing the anchor.

**_Fishing Tackle._** This kit includes a wooden rod, silken line, corkwood bobbers, steel hooks, lead sinkers, velvet lures, and nbullet netting.
Healer’s Kit. This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check.

**_Hunting Trap._** When you use your action to set it, this trap forms a saw-toothed steel ring that snaps shut when a creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage and stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals 1 piercing damage to the trapped creature.

**_Flashlight._** A flashlight casts bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a battery.

**_Lock._** A key is provided with the lock. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves’ tools can pick this lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Your GM may decide that better locks are available for higher prices.

**_Magnifying Glass._** This lens allows a closer look at small objects. It is also useful as a substitute for flint and steel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass requires light as bright as sunlight to focus, tinder to ignite, and about 5 minutes for the fire to ignite. A magnifying glass grants advantage on any ability check made to appraise or inspect an item that is small or highly detailed.

**_Manacles._** These metal restraints can bind a Small or Medium creature. Escaping the manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. Breaking them requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. Each set of manacles comes with one key. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves’ tools can pick the manacles’ lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Manacles have 15 hit points.

**_Mess Kit._** This tin box contains a cup and simple cutlery. The box clamps together, and one side can be used as a cooking pan and the other as a plate or shallow bowl.

**_Poison, Basic._** You can use the poison in this vial to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammunition must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying.

**_Potion of Healing._** A character who drinks the tek red fluid in this vial regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. Drinking or administering a potion takes an action.

**_Pouch._** A cloth or leather pouch can hold up to 20 sling bullets or 50 blowgun needles, among other things. A compartmentalized pouch for holding tek skill components is called a component pouch (described earlier in this section). Quiver. A quiver can hold up to 20 bullets.
Ram, Portable. You can use a portable ram to break down doors. When doing so, you gain a +4 bonus on the Strength check. One other character can help you use the ram, giving you advantage on this check.

**_Rations._** Rations consist of dry foods suitable for extended travel, including jerky, dried fruit, hardtack, and nuts.

**_Rope._** Rope, whether made of hemp or silk, has 2 hit points and can be burst with a DC 17 Strength check.

**_tekcaster._** Implement with which tek skills are cast.

**_Tent._** A simple and portable canvas shelter, a tent sleeps two.

### Tools

A tool helps you to do something you couldn't otherwise do, such as craft or repair an item, forge a document, or pick a lock. Your race, class, background, or feats give you proficiency with certain tools. Proficiency with a tool allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make using that tool. Tool use is not tied to a single ability, since proficiency with a tool represents broader knowledge of its use. For example, the GM might ask you to make a Dexterity check to carve a fine detail with your woodcarver’s tools, or a Strength check to make something out of particularly hard wood.

```
```
## Tinker’s Tools

These special tools include the items needed to pursue a craft or trade. The table shows examples of the most common types of tools, each providing items related to a single craft. Proficiency with a set of artisan's tools lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make using the tools in your craft. Each type of artisan's tools requires a separate proficiency. Using Tinker’s tools you can repair electronic and mechanical devices with an ability check.

## Disguise Kit

A device in the shape of a mask that injects gel into your face to change your appearance. The gel can be removed by using the disguise kit. After 24 hours the gem must be reapplied or it loses its form.

## Forgery Kit

This small box contains a plastics fabricator, network slicing kit, and other supplies necessary to create convincing forgeries of physical and virtual documents. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to create a physical or virtual forgery of a document.
Gaming Set. A small box containing VR optics and haptic gloves for non-immersive VR gaming. It also contains either a set of dice, deck of playing cards, or a chess set.

## Botanist’s Kit
This kit contains a variety of instruments such as clippers, mortar and pestle, and pouches and vials used by herbalists to create remedies and potions. It also contains a specialized datapad that can be used to identify plants. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to identify or apply herbs. Also, proficiency with this kit is required to create antitoxin and potions of healing.

## Musical Instrument

Several of the most common types of musical instruments are shown on the table as examples. If you have proficiency with a given musical instrument, you can add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to play music with the instrument. Each type of musical instrument requires a separate proficiency.

## Navigator's Kit

This specialized datapad is used for navigation in space. Proficiency with navigator's tools lets you chart a ship's course and follow navigation charts. In addition, it allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make to avoid getting lost in space. In the event that a ship’s navigation data is out of date or offline, you can override the navigation controls from the ship’s helm using this device. You can update the star charts on your Navigator’s Datapad at most colonies and stations.

### Expenses

When not descending into the depths of space, exploring ruins for lost loot, or waging war against the encroaching darkness, adventurers face more mundane realities. Even in a futuristic world, people require basic necessities such as shelter, sustenance, and clothing. These things cost money, although some lifestyles cost more than others.

#### Lifestyle Expenses

Lifestyle expenses provide you with a simple way to account for the cost of living in a futuristic world. They cover your accommodations, food and drink, and all your other necessities. Furthermore, expenses cover the cost of maintaining your equipment so you can be ready when adventure next calls.

At the start of each week or month (your choice), choose a lifestyle from the Expenses table and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle. The prices listed are per day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of your chosen lifestyle over a thirty-day period, multiply the listed price by 30. Your lifestyle might change from one period to the next, based on the funds you have at your disposal, or you might maintain the same lifestyle throughout your character’s career.

Your lifestyle choice can have consequences. Maintaining a wealthy lifestyle might help you make contacts with the rich and powerful, though you run the risk of attracting thieves. Likewise, living frugally might help you avoid criminals, but you are unlikely to make powerful connections.

**Lifestyle Expenses (table)**

| Lifestyle    | Price/Day     |
|--------------|---------------|
| Wretched     | —             |
| Squalid      | 1000 credits         |
| Poor         | 2000 credits         |
| Modest       | 100 credits          |
| Comfortable  | 200 credits          |
| Wealthy      | 400 credits          |
| Aristocratic | 1000 credits minimum |

**_Wretched._** You live in inhumane conditions. With no place to call home, you shelter wherever you can, Stealthing into barns, huddling in old crates, and relying on the good graces of people better off than you. A wretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched people covet your armor, weapons, and adventuring gear, which represent a fortune by their standards. You are beneath the notice of most people.

**_Squalid._** You live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut just outside town, or a vermin-infested boarding house in the worst part of town. You have shelter from the elements, but you live in a desperate and often violent environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and misfortune. You are beneath the notice of most people, and you have few legal protections. Most people at this lifestyle level have suffered some terrible setback. They might be disturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer from disease.

**_Poor._** A poor lifestyle means going without the comforts available in a stable community. Simple food and lodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant, experience. Your accommodations might be a room in a flophouse or in the common room above a tavern. You benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to contend with violence, crime, and disease. People at this lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, costermongers, peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and other disreputable types.

**_Modest._** A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums and ensures that you can maintain your equipment. You live in an older part of town, renting a room in a boarding house, inn, or temple. You don’t go hungry or thirsty, and your living conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary people living modest lifestyles include soldiers with families, laborers, students, priests, hedge Arcanists, and the like.

**_Comfortable._** Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily maintain your equipment. You live in a small cottage in a middle-class neighborhood or in a private room at a fine inn. You associate with merchants, skilled tradespeople, and military officers.

**_Wealthy._** Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a life of luxury, though you might not have achieved the social status associated with the old money of nobility or royalty. You live a lifestyle comparable to that of a highly successful merchant, a favored servant of the royalty, or the owner of a few small businesses. You have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a good part of town or a comfortable suite at a fine inn. You likely have a small staff of servants.

**_Aristocratic._** You live a life of plenty and comfort. You move in circles populated by the most powerful people in the community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps a townhouse in the nicest part of town or rooms in the finest inn. You dine at the best restaurants, retain the most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants attending to your every need. You receive invitations to the social gatherings of the rich and powerful, and spend evenings in the company of politicians, guild leaders, high priests, and nobility. You must also contend with the highest levels of deceit and treachery. The wealthier you are, the greater the chance you will be drawn into political intrigue as a pawn or participant.

> ##### Self-Sufficiency
>
> The expenses and lifestyles described here assume that you are spending your time between adventures in town, availing yourself of whatever services you can afford—paying for food and shelter, paying townspeople to sharpen your sword and repair your armor, and so on. Some characters, though, might prefer to spend their time away from civilization, sustaining themselves in the wild by hunting, foraging, and repairing their own gear.
>
> Maintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn’t require you to spend any coin, but it is time-consuming. If you spend your time between adventures practicing a profession, you can eke out the equivalent of a poor lifestyle. Proficiency in the Nature skill lets you live at the equivalent of a comfortable lifestyle.

#### Services

Adventurers can pay nonplayer characters to assist them or act on their behalf in a variety of circumstances. Most such hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while others are masters of a craft or art, and a few are experts with specialized adventuring skills.

Some of the most basic types of hirelings appear on the Services table. Other common hirelings include any of the wide variety of people who inhabit a typical town or city, when the adventurers pay them to perform a specific task. For example, an arcanist might pay a carpenter to construct an elaborate chest (and its miniature replica) for use in the *secret chest* tek skill. A soldier might commission a blacksmith to forge a special sword. A evangelist might pay a tailor to make exquisite clothing for an upcoming performance in front of the duke.

Other hirelings provide more expert or dangerous services. Mercenary soldiers paid to help the adventurers take on a hobgoblin army are hirelings, as are sages hired to research ancient or esoteric lore. If a high-level adventurer establishes a stronghold of some kind, he or she might hire a whole staff of servants and agents to run the place, from a castellan or steward to menial laborers to keep the stables clean. These hirelings often enjoy a long-term contract that includes a place to live within the stronghold as part of the offered compensation.

Skilled hirelings include anyone hired to perform a service that involves a proficiency (including weapon, tool, or skill): a mercenary, artisan, scribe, and so on. The pay shown is a minimum; some expert hirelings require more pay. Untrained hirelings are hired for menial work that requires no particular skill and can include laborers, porters, maids, and similar workers.

**Services (table)**

| Service Pay       | Pay           |
|-------------------|---------------|
| **_Coach cab_**   |               |
| - Between towns   | 30 credits per mile |
| - Within a city   | 10 credits          |
| **_Hireling_**    |               |
| - Skilled         | 200 credits per day  |
| - Untrained       | 2000 credits per day  |
| Messenger         | 20 credits per mile |
| Road or gate toll | 10 credits          |
| Ship’s passage    | 10,000 credits per day |

#### Tekcasting Services

People who are able to cast tek skills don’t fall into the category of ordinary hirelings. It might be possible to find someone willing to cast a tek skill in exchange for coin or favors, but it is rarely easy and no established pay rates exist. As a rule, the higher the level of the desired tek skill, the harder it is to find someone who can cast it and the more it costs.

Hiring someone to cast a relatively common tek skill of 1st or 2nd level, such as *cure wounds* or *identify*, is easy enough in a city or town, and might cost 10 to 50 gold pieces (plus the cost of any expensive material components). Finding someone able and willing to cast a higher-level tek skill might involve traveling to a large city, perhaps one with a university or prominent temple. Once found, the tekcaster might ask for a service instead of payment—the kind of service that only adventurers can provide, such as retrieving a rare item from a dangerous locale or traversing a monster-infested wilderness to deliver something important to a distant colony.

<!-- Feats -->
\page
## Feats

---

A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides.

At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat’s description says otherwise.

You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat’s prerequisite, you can’t use that feat until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Grappler feat requires you to have a Strength of 13 or higher. If your Strength is reduced below 13 somehow—perhaps by a withering hack—you can’t benefit from the Grappler feat until your Strength is restored.

### Advantage and Disadvantage

Sometimes a special ability or tek skill tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll. When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.

If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don’t roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.

If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.

You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, or tek skills. Inspiration can also give a character advantage. The

GM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.

### Proficiency Bonus

Characters have a proficiency bonus determined by level. Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.

Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when you make the save.

Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. For example, the scoundrel’s Expertise feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability checks. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and multiply or divide it only once.

By the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn’t normally benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don’t add the bonus to the check. For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if you lack proficiency in the History skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence (History) checks.

In general, you don’t multiply your proficiency bonus for attack rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect allows you to do so, these same rules apply.

#### Contests

Sometimes one character’s or monster’s efforts are directly opposed to another’s. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a tek ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal— for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.

Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding.

If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that the door remains shut.

##### Attack Rolls and Damage

You add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as a scorcher, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand* to-hand combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack.

##### Lifting and Carrying

Your Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.

**_Carrying Capacity._** Your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that most characters don’t usually have to worry about it.

**_Push, Drag, or Lift._** You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.

**_Size and Strength._** Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the creature’s carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.

##### Variant: Encumbrance

The rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple. Here is a variant if you are looking for more detailed rules for determining how a character is hindered by the weight of equipment. When you use this variant, ignore the Strength column of the Armor table.

If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are **encumbered**, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.

\page

If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are instead **heavily encumbered**, which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.


##### Armor Class

Depending on the armor you wear, you might add some or all of your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class.

##### Initiative

At the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making a Dexterity check. Initiative determines the order of creatures’ turns in combat.

> #### Hiding
>
> The DM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check’s total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.
>
>You can’t hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase.
>
>An invisible creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.
>
>In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the DM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.
>
> **_Passive Perception._** When you hide, there’s a chance someone will notice you even if they aren’t searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the DM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature’s Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. For example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 14.
>
> **_What Can You See?**_ One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be **lightly** or **heavily obscured**, as explained in chapter 8, “Adventuring.”

##### Hit Points

Your Toughness modifier contributes to your hit points. Typically, you add your Toughness modifier to each Hit Die you roll for your hit points.

```
```
##### Tekcasting Ability

Evangelists, guardians, scions, and cybernetics use Charisma and Will as their Tekcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of tek skills they cast.

### Saving Throws

A saving throw—also called a save—represents an attempt to resist a tek skill, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don’t normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one because your character or monster is at risk of harm.

To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. For example, you use your Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity saving throw.

A saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and can be affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined by the GM.

Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The Arcanist, for example, is proficient in Intelligence saves. As with skill proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or her proficiency bonus to saving throws made using a particular ability score. Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well.

The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a tek skill is determined by the caster’s Tekcasting ability and proficiency bonus.

The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in the effect that allows the save. Usually, a successful save means that a creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.

### Time

In situations where keeping track of the passage of time is important, the GM determines the time a task requires. The GM might use a different time scale depending on the context of the situation at hand. In a dungeon environment, the adventurers’ movement happens on a scale of **minutes**. It takes them about a minute to creep down a long hallway, another minute to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes to search the chamber beyond for anything interesting or valuable.

In a city or wilderness, a scale of **hours** is often more appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower at the heart of the forest hurry across those fifteen miles in just under four hours’ time.

For long journeys, a scale of **days** works best.

Following the road from Baldur’s Gate to Waterdeep, the adventurers spend four uneventful days before a goblin ambush interrupts their journey.

In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on **rounds**, a 6-second span of time.

\page

### Movement

Swimming across a rushing river, Stealthing down a dungeon corridor, scaling a treacherous mountain slope—all sorts of movement play a key role in futuristic gaming adventures.

The GM can summarize the adventurers’ movement without calculating exact distances or travel times: “You travel through the forest and find the dungeon entrance late in the evening of the third day.” Even in a dungeon, particularly a large dungeon or a cave network, the GM can summarize movement between encounters: “After killing the guardian at the entrance to the ancient dwarven stronghold, you consult your map, which leads you through miles of echoing corridors to a chasm bridged by a nbullet stone arch.”

Sometimes it’s important, though, to know how long it takes to get from one spot to another, whether the answer is in days, hours, or minutes. The rules for determining travel time depend on two factors: the speed and travel pace of the creatures moving and the terrain they’re moving over.

#### Speed

Every character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in feet that the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life* threatening situation.

The following rules determine how far a character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.

##### Travel Pace

While traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to Stealth around and to search an area more carefully.

**_Forced March._** The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.

For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion (see appendix A).

**_Mounts and Vehicles._** For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.

Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel, and they don’t suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.

Certain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, or special vehicles, such as a *carpet of flying*, allow you to travel more swiftly.

**Travel Pace (table)**

| Pace   | Distance per: Minute | Hour    | Day      | Effect                                           |
|--------|----------------------|---------|----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Fast   | 400 feet             | 4 miles | 30 miles | −5 penalty to passive Wisdom (Perception) scores |
| Normal | 300 feet             | 3 miles | 18 miles | —                                                |
| Slow   | 200 feet             | 2 miles | 24 miles | Able to use stealth                              |

##### Difficult Terrain

The travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear dungeon corridors. But adventurers often face dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep mountains, and ice-covered ground—all considered difficult terrain.

You move at half speed in difficult terrain— moving 1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed—so you can cover only half the normal distance in a minute, an hour, or a day.

#### Special Types of Movement

Movement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness areas often involves more than simply walking. Adventurers might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get where they need to go.

##### Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling

While climbing or swimming, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing or swimming speed. At the GM’s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds requires a successful Strength (Physique) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful Strength (Physique) check.

##### Jumping

Your Strength determines how far you can jump.

**_Long Jump._** When you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet up to your Strength score if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement.

This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn’t matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM’s option, you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Physique) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump’s distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.

When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.


**_High Jump._** When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to 3 + your Strength modifier if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. In some circumstances, your GM might allow you to make a Strength (Physique) check to jump higher than you normally can.

\page

You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1½ times your height.

### The Environment

By its nature, adventuring involves delving into places that are dark, dangerous, and full of mysteries to be explored. The rules in this section cover some of the most important ways in which adventurers interact with the environment in such places.

#### Falling

A fall from a great height is one of the most common hazards facing an adventurer. At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. The creature lands prone, unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.

#### Suffocating

A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).

When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can’t regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.

For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points.

#### Vision and Light

The most fundamental tasks of adventuring— noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a tek skill, to name just a few—rely heavily on a character’s ability to see. Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.

A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a **lightly obscured** area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

A **heavily obscured** area—such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage—blocks vision entirely. A creature effectively suffers from the blinded condition (see appendix A) when trying to see something in that area.

The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.

**Bright light** lets most creatures see normally.

Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.

**Dim light**, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.

**Darkness** creates a heavily obscured area.

Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of tek darkness.

```
```

##### Blindsight

A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as oozes, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons, have this sense.

##### Darkvision

Many creatures in futuristic gaming worlds, especially those that dwell underground, have darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision can see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature is concerned. However, the creature can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

##### Truesight

A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and tek darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceives the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by tek. Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.

#### Food and Water

Characters who don’t eat or drink suffer the effects of exhaustion (see appendix A). Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can’t be removed until the character eats and drinks the full required amount.

##### Food

A character needs one pound of food per day and can make food last longer by subsisting on half rations. Eating half a pound of food in a day counts as half a day without food.

A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end of each day beyond that limit, a character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion.

A normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.

##### Water

A character needs one gallon of water per day, or two gallons per day if the weather is hot. A character who drinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion at the end of the day. A character with access to even less water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of the day.

If the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character takes two levels in either case.

\page
#### Interacting with Objects

A character’s interaction with objects in an environment is often simple to resolve in the game. The player tells the GM that his or her character is doing something, such as moving a lever, and the GM describes what, if anything, happens.


For example, a character might decide to pull a lever, which might, in turn, raise a portcullis, cause a room to flood with water, or open a secret door in a nearby wall. If the lever is rusted in position, though, a character might need to force it. In such a situation, the GM might call for a Strength check to see whether the character can wrench the lever into place. The GM sets the DC for any such check based on the difficulty of the task.

Characters can also damage objects with their weapons and tek skills. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage, but otherwise they can be affected by physical and tek attacks much like creatures can. The GM determines an object’s Armor Class and hit points, and might decide that certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks. (It’s hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects always fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and they are immune to effects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks.

A character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object. The GM sets the DC for any such check.

```
```

### Resting

Heroic though they might be, adventurers can’t spend every hour of the day in the thick of exploration, social interaction, and combat. They need rest—time to sleep and eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds and spirits for Tekcasting, and brace themselves for further adventure.

Adventurers can take short rests in the midst of an adventuring day and a long rest to end the day.

#### Short Rest

A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.

A character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to the character’s maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character’s level. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character’s Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total. The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. A character regains some spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest, as explained below.

#### Long Rest

A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps or performs light activity: reading, talking, eating, or standing watch for no more than 2 hours. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity—at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting tek skills, or similar adventuring activity—the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it.

At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal to half of the character’s total number of them (minimum of one die). For example, if a character has eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain four spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest.

A character can’t benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.

<!-- Downtime -->
\page
### Between Adventures

Between trips to dungeons and battles against ancient evils, adventurers need time to rest, recuperate, and prepare for their next adventure. Many adventurers also use this time to perform other tasks, such as crafting arms and armor, performing research, or spending their hard-earned gold.

In some cases, the passage of time is something that occurs with little fanfare or description. When starting a new adventure, the GM might simply declare that a certain amount of time has passed and allow you to describe in general terms what your character has been doing. At other times, the GM might want to keep track of just how much time is passing as events beyond your perception stay in motion.

#### Lifestyle Expenses

Between adventures, you choose a particular quality of life and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle.

Living a particular lifestyle doesn’t have a huge effect on your character, but your lifestyle can affect the way other individuals and groups react to you. For example, when you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier for you to influence the nobles of the city than if you live in poverty.

#### Downtime Activities

Between adventures, the GM might ask you what your character is doing during his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can vary in duration, but each downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.

Downtime activities other than the ones presented below are possible. If you want your character to spend his or her downtime performing an activity not covered here, discuss it with your GM.

##### Crafting

You can craft nontek objects, including adventuring equipment and works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the object you are trying to create (typically artisan’s tools). You might also need access to special materials or locations necessary to create it.

For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 500 credits, and you must expend raw materials worth half the total market value. If something you want to craft has a market value greater than 500 credits, you make progress every day in 500 credits increments until you reach the market value of the item. For example, a suit of plate armor (market value 150000 credits) takes 300 days to craft by yourself.

Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each character contributes 500 credits worth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a suit of plate armor in 100 days, at a total cost of 75000 credits.

While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 100 credits per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost.

##### Practicing a Profession

You can work between adventures, allowing you to maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 100 credits per day. This benefit lasts as long you continue to practice your profession.
If you are a member of an organization that can provide gainful employment, such as a temple or a thieves’ guild, you earn enough to support a comfortable lifestyle instead.
If you have proficiency in the Performance skill and put your performance skill to use during your downtime, you earn enough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead.

##### Recuperating

You can use downtime between adventures to recover from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison.

After three days of downtime spent recuperating, you can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, you can choose one of the following results:

* End one effect on you that prevents you from regaining hit points.
* For the next 24 hours, gain advantage on saving throws against one disease or poison currently affecting you.

##### Researching

The time between adventures is a great chance to perform research, gaining insight into mysteries that have unfurled over the course of the campaign.

For each day of research, you must spend 100 credits to cover your expenses. This cost is in addition to your normal lifestyle expenses.

##### Training

You can spend time between adventures learning a new language or training with a set of tools. Your GM might allow additional training options.

First, you must find an instructor willing to teach you. The GM determines how long it takes, and whether one or more ability checks are required.

The training lasts for 250 days and costs 100 credits per day. After you spend the requisite amount of time and money, you learn the new language or gain proficiency with the new tool.

<!-- Combat -->
\page
## The Order of Combat

---

A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and Tekcasting. The game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A
**round** represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a **turn**. The order of turns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated the other.

> #### Combat Step by Step
>
> 1.  **Determine surprise.** The GM determines whether anyone involved in the combat encounter is surprised.
> 2.  **Establish positions.** The GM decides where all the characters and monsters are located. Given the adventurers’ marching order or their stated positions in the room or other location, the GM figures out where the adversaries are̶how far away and in what direction.
> 3.  **Roll initiative.** Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls initiative, determining the order of combatants’ turns.
> 4.  **Take turns.** Each participant in the battle takes a turn in initiative order.
> 5.  **Begin the next round.** When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until the fighting stops.

#### Surprise

A band of adventurers Stealths up on a bandit camp, springing from the trees to attack them. A gelatinous cube glides down a dungeon passage, unnoticed by the adventurers until the cube engulfs one of them. In these situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the other.

The GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the GM compares the Dexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn’t notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.

If you’re surprised, you can’t move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can’t take a reaction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren’t.

#### Initiative

Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every participant makes a Dexterity check to determine their place in the initiative order. The GM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same time.

The GM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with the lowest. This is the order (called the initiative order) in which they act during each round. The initiative order remains the same from round to round.

If a tie occurs, the GM decides the order among tied GM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the order among their tied characters. The GM can decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character. Optionally, the GM can have the tied characters and monsters each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest roll going first.

#### Your Turn

On your turn, you can **move** a distance up to your speed and **take one action**. You decide whether to move first or take your action first. Your speed— sometimes called your walking speed—is noted on your character sheet.

The most common actions you can take are described in the “Actions in Combat” section later in this chapter. Many class features and other abilities provide additional options for your action.

The “Movement and Position” section later in this chapter gives the rules for your move.

You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can’t decide what to do on your turn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, as described in “Actions in Combat.”

##### Bonus Actions

Various class features, tek skills, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action. The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows a scoundrel to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action only when a special ability, tek skill, or other feature of the game states that you can do something as a bonus action. You otherwise don’t have a bonus action to take.

You can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than one available.

You choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the bonus action’s timing is specified, and anything that deprives you of your ability to take actions also prevents you from taking a bonus action.

##### Other Activity on Your Turn

Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your action nor your move.

You can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.

You can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action. For example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.

If you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action. Some alien artifacts and other special objects always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.

The GM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the GM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.

\page

#### Reactions

Certain special abilities, tek skills, and situations allow you to take a special action called a reaction. A reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else’s. The opportunity attack, described later in this chapter, is the most common type of reaction.

When you take a reaction, you can’t take another one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature’s turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the reaction.

### Movement and Position

In combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain the upper hand.

On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as much or as little of your speed as you like on your turn, following the rules here.

Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can constitute your entire move. However you’re moving, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done moving.

#### Breaking Up Your Move

You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move 10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.

##### Moving between Attacks

If you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you can break up your movement even further by moving between those attacks. For example, a soldier who can make two attacks with the Extra Attack feature and who has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, make an attack, move 15 feet, and then attack again.

##### Using Different Speeds

If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you’ve already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can’t use the new speed during the current move.

For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60 because an arcanist cast the *fly* tek skill on you, you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, and then leap into the air to fly 30 feet more.

#### Difficult Terrain

Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains. Boulder-strewn caverns, briar* choked forests, treacherous staircases—the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.

Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.

Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.

#### Being Prone

Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they are prone, a condition described in appendix A.

You can **drop prone** without using any of your speed. **Standing up** takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend

15 feet of movement to stand up. You can’t stand up if you don’t have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.

To move while prone, you must **crawl** or use tek such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of movement.

### Interacting with Objects Around You

Here are a few examples of the sorts of thing you can do in tandem with your movement and action:

* draw or sheathe a weapon
* open or close a door
* withdraw a potion from your backpack
* pick up a dropped axe
* take a bauble from a table
* remove a ring from your finger
* stuff some food into your mouth
* plant a banner in the ground
* fish a few coins from your belt pouch
* drink all the ale in a flagon
* throw a lever or a switch
* pull a torch from a sconce
* take a book from a shelf you can reach
* extinguish a small flame
* don a mask
* pull the hood of your cloak up and over your head
* put your ear to a door
* kick a small stone
* turn a key in a lock
* tap the floor with a 10-foot pole
* hand an item to another character

#### Moving Around Other Creatures

You can move through a nonhostile creature’s space. In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature’s space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature’s space is difficult terrain for you.

Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can’t willingly end your move in its space.

If you leave a hostile creature’s reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity attack, as explained later in the chapter.


\page

#### Flying Movement

Flying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but they must also deal with the danger of falling. If a flying creature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held aloft by tek, such as by the *fly* tek skill.


#### Null Gravity
While moving in null gravity you must make an Acrobatics ability check determine success. If you aren't careful you can miss, undershoot, or overshoot and go spinning in a random direction. When moving in null gravity you maintain momentum until you run into a solid object. In a large space you may use one turn to move your movement speed. You will continue to move your movement speed every subsequent turn until you run into something, or are able to propel yourself somehow. Grav Boots and Jet Packs are very useful in Null G.

#### Creature Size

Each creature takes up a different amount of space. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. Objects sometimes use the same size categories.

**Size Categories (table)**

| Size       | Space                  |
|------------|------------------------|
| Tiny       | 2½ by 2½ ft.           |
| Small      | 5 by 5 ft.             |
| Medium     | 5 by 5 ft.             |
| Large      | 10 by 10 ft.           |
| Huge       | 15 by 15 ft.           |
| Gargantuan | 20 by 20 ft. or larger |

##### Space

A creature’s space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium creature isn’t 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5* foot-wide doorway, other creatures can’t get through unless the hobgoblin lets them.

A creature’s space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there’s a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one.

Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If five Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there’s little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.

##### Squeezing into a Smaller Space

A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that’s only 5 feet wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it’s in the smaller space.

### Actions in Combat

When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your class or a special feature, or an action that you improvise. Many monsters have action options of their own in their stat blocks.

When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the GM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.

#### Attack

The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an bullet from a bow, or brawling with your fists.

With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the “Making an Attack” section for the rules that govern attacks.

Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the soldier, allow you to make more than one attack with this action.

#### Cast a Tek

Tekcasters such as Arcanists and priests, as well as many monsters, have access to tek skills and can use them to great effect in combat. Each tek skill has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the tek skill. Casting a tek skill is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most tek skills do have a casting time of 1 action, so a tekcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a tek skill.

#### Dash

When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you dash.

Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you dash.

#### Disengage

If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.

#### Dodge

When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated (as explained in appendix A) or if your speed drops to 0.

\page

#### Help

You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn.

Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally’s attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage.

#### Hide

When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the “Unseen Attackers and Targets” section later in this chapter.

#### Ready

Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn.

First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include “If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I’ll pull the lever that opens it,” and “If the goblin steps next to me, I move away.”

When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.

When you ready a tek skill, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a tek skill must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the tek skill’s tek requires concentration. If your concentration is broken, the tek skill dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the _web_ tek skill and ready _tek missile_, your _web_ tek skill ends, and if you take damage before you release _tek missile_ with your reaction, your concentration might be broken.

#### Search

When you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search, the GM might have you make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check.

#### Use an Object

You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When an object requires your action for its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn.

### Making an Attack

Whether you’re striking with a melee weapon, firing a weapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a tek skill, an attack has a simple structure.

1. **Choose a target.** Pick a target within your attack’s range: a creature, an object, or a location.
2. **Determine modifiers.** The GM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage against the target. In addition, tek skills, special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.
3. **Resolve the attack.** You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead of damage.

If there’s ever any question whether something you’re doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you’re making an attack roll, you’re making an attack.

#### Attack Rolls

When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target’s Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. The AC of a character is determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a monster is in its stat block.

##### Modifiers to the Roll

When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character’s proficiency bonus. When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat block.

**_Ability Modifier_** The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that have the finesse or thrown property break this rule.

Some tek skills also require an attack roll. The ability modifier used for a tek skill attack depends on the Tekcasting ability of the tekcaster.

**_Proficiency Bonus_** You add your proficiency bonus to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with which you have proficiency, as well as when you attack with a tek skill.

##### Rolling 1 or 20

Sometimes fate blesses or hacks a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.

If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC. This is called a critical hit, which is explained later in this chapter.

If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC.

#### Unseen Attackers and Targets

Combatants often try to escape their foes’ notice by hiding, casting the invisibility tek skill, or lurking in darkness.

When you attack a target that you can’t see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether you’re guessing the target’s location or you’re targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn’t in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the GM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the target’s location correctly.

\page

When a creature can’t see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it. If you are hidden—both unseen and unheard—when you make an attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.

#### Ranged Attacks

When you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a crossbow, hurl a handaxe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe at a distance. A monster might shoot spines from its tail. Many tek skills also involve making a ranged attack.

##### Range

You can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range.

If a ranged attack, such as one made with a tek skill, has a single range, you can’t attack a target beyond this range.

Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a railrifle or a scorcher, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your target is beyond normal range, and you can’t attack a target beyond the long range.

##### Ranged Attacks in Close Combat

Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a tek skill, or some other means, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see you and who isn’t incapacitated.

#### Melee Attacks

Used in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon such as a sword, an ion slingblade, or an axe. A typical monster makes a melee attack when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other body part. A few tek skills also involve making a melee attack.

Most creatures have a 5-foot **reach** and can thus attack targets within 5 feet of them when making a melee attack. Certain creatures (typically those larger than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.

Instead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use an **unarmed strike**: a punch, kick, head-butt, or similar forceful blow (none of which count as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + your Strength modifier. You are proficient with your unarmed strikes.

##### Opportunity Attacks

In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance to strike an enemy who is fleeing or passing by. Such a strike is called an opportunity attack.

You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach.

You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the Disengage action. You also don’t provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport or when someone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction. For example, you don’t provoke an opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe’s reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.

##### Two-Weapon Fighting

When you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon that you’re holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different light melee weapon that you’re holding in the other hand. You don’t add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.

If either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it.

##### Grappling

When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.

The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check instead of an attack roll: a Strength (Physique) check contested by the target’s Strength (Physique) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled condition (see appendix A). The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).

**_Escaping a Grapple_** A grappled creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Physique) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your Strength
(Physique) check.

**_Moving a Grappled Creature_** When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.

> #### Contests in Combat
>
> Battle often involves pitting your prowess against that of your foe. Such a challenge is represented by a contest. This section includes the most common contests that require an action in combat: grappling and shoving a creature. The GM can use these contests as models for improvising others.

##### Shoving a Creature

Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or push it away from you. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.

\page

The target must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Instead of making an attack roll, you make a Strength (Physique) check contested by the target’s Strength (Physique) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you win the contest, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from you.

### Cover

Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.

There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren’t added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.

A target with **half cover** has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a nbullet tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.

A target with **three-quarters cover** has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an bullet slit, or a thick tree trunk.

A target with **total cover** can’t be targeted directly by an attack or a tek skill, although some tek skills can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.

### Damage and Healing

Injury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who explore futuristic gaming worlds. The thrust of a sword, a well-placed bullet, or a blast of flame from a *fireball* tek skill all have the potential to damage, or even kill, the hardiest of creatures.

#### Hit Points

Hit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more fragile.

A creature’s current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be any number from the creature’s hit point maximum down to 0. This number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing.

Whenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature’s capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points.

#### Damage Rolls

Each weapon, tek skill, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to your target. Tek weapons, special abilities, and other factors can grant a bonus to damage. With a penalty, it is possible to deal 0 damage, but never negative damage.

When attacking with a **weapon**, you add your ability modifier—the same modifier used for the attack roll—to the damage. A **tek skill** tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers.

If a tek skill or other effect deals damage to **more than one target** at the same time, roll the damage once for all of them. For example, when an arcanist casts _fireball_ or a priest casts _flame strike_, the tek skill’s damage is rolled once for all creatures caught in the blast.

##### Critical Hits

When you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the attack’s damage against the target. Roll all of the attack’s damage dice twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, you can roll all the damage dice at once.

For example, if you score a critical hit with an ion dagger, roll 2d4 for the damage, rather than 1d4, and then add your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the scoundrel’s Stealth Attack feature, you roll those dice twice as well.

##### Damage Types

Different attacks, damaging tek skills, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.

The damage types follow, with examples to help a GM assign a damage type to a new effect.

**_Acid_** The corrosive spray of a black dragon’s breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage.

**_Bludgeoning_** Blunt force attacks—hammers, falling, constriction, and the like—deal bludgeoning damage.

**_Cold_** The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil’s spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon’s breath deal cold damage.

**_Fire_** Red dragons breathe fire, and many tek skills conjure flames to deal fire damage.

**_Force_** Force is pure tek energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are tek skills, including _tek missile_ and _spiritual weapon_.

**_Shock_** A _lightning bolt_ tek skill and a blue dragon’s breath deal lightning damage.

**_Radiation_** Radiation damage, dealt by certain undead and a tek skill such as _chill touch_, withers matter and even the soul.

**_Piercing_** Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and monsters’ bites, deal piercing damage.

**_Poison_** Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green dragon’s breath deal poison damage.

**_Psychic_** Mental abilities such as a mind flayer’s psionic blast deal psychic damage.

**_Radiant_** Radiant damage, dealt by a priest’s _flame strike_ tek skill or an angel’s smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.

**_Slashing_** Swords, axes, and monsters’ claws deal slashing damage.

**_Concussive_** A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the _shockwave_ tek skill, deals concussive damage.

\page

#### Damage Resistance and Vulnerability

Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.

If a creature or an object has **resistance** to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has **vulnerability** to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.

Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a tek aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.

Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all nontek damage, the damage of a nontek fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three* quarters.

#### Healing

Unless it results in death, damage isn’t permanent. Even death is reversible through powerful tek. Rest can restore a creature’s hit points, and tek methods such as a _cure wounds_ tek skill or a _potion of healing_ can remove damage in an instant.

When a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature’s hit points can’t exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a morph grants a scout 8 hit points of healing. If the scout has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the scout regains 6 hit points from the morph, not 8.

A creature that has died can’t regain hit points until tek such as the _revivify_ tek skill has restored it to life.

#### Dropping to 0 Hit Points

When you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections.

##### Instant Death

Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.

For example, a priest with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the priest dies.

##### Falling Unconscious

If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall unconscious (see appendix A). This unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.

##### Death Saving Throws

Whenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn’t tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by tek skills and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw.

Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable.

**_Rolling 1 or 20_** When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.

**_Damage at 0 Hit Points_** If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.

##### Stabilizing a Creature

The best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that it isn’t killed by a failed death saving throw.

You can use your action to administer first aid to an unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.

A **stable** creature doesn’t make death saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious. The creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn’t healed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.

##### Monsters and Death

Most GMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it fall unconscious and make death saving throws.

Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the GM might have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as player characters.

#### Knocking a Creature Out

Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls unconscious and is stable.

#### Temporary Hit Points

Some tek skills and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a creature. Temporary hit points aren’t actual hit points; they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from injury.

When you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage.

\page

Because temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character can, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.

Healing can’t restore temporary hit points, and they can’t be added together. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a tek skill grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.

If you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn’t restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. They can still absorb damage directed at you while you’re in that state, but only true healing can save you.

Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, they last until they’re depleted or you finish a long rest.

### Mounted Combat

A knight charging into battle on a warhorse, an arcanist casting tek skills from the back of a griffon, or a priest soaring through the sky on a pegasus all enjoy the benefits of speed and mobility that a mount can provide.

A willing creature that is at least one size larger than you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount, using the following rules.

#### Mounting and Dismounting

Once during your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to mount a horse. Therefore, you can’t mount it if you don’t have 15 feet of movement left or if your speed is 0.

If an effect moves your mount against its will while you’re on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off the mount, landing prone in a space within 5 feet of it. If you’re knocked prone while mounted, you must make the same saving throw.

If your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall prone in a space within 5 feet it.

#### Controlling a Mount

You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assumed to have such training. The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has only three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it.

An independent mount retains its place in the initiative order. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the actions the mount can take, and it moves and acts as it wishes. It might flee from combat, rush to attack and devour a badly injured foe, or otherwise act against your wishes.

In either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity attack while you’re on it, the attacker can target you or the mount.

### Mechanical Mounts
Mechanical mounts move on your turn, and some have certain restrictions for what actions you can take.

### Underwater Combat

When adventurers pursue sahuagin back to their undersea homes, fight off sharks in an ancient shipwreck, or find themselves in a flooded dungeon room, they must fight in a challenging environment. Underwater the following rules apply.

When making a **melee weapon attack**, a creature that doesn’t have a swimming speed (either natural or granted by tek) has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon is an ion dagger, javelin, ion blade, spear, or trident.

A **ranged weapon attack** automatically misses a target beyond the weapon’s normal range. Even against a target within normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear, trident, or dart).

Creatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have resistance to fire damage.

## Squad Combat

Whether you employ a squad of mercenaries, or your family/corporation have marine retainers in their service, having a squad of marines at your back is essential for many types of incursions. A group of marines can be broken up into any number of squads, but each squad will only take orders from 1 PC leader.

Mercenaries are expendable soldiers that can make or break any combat engagement. Many mercenaries have stack insurance ensuring that if they are killed in battle, they will receive a new sleeve. Real death is rare among mercenaries, and most will avoid aiming for the stack of a fellow mercenary as honor demands.

### Mercenary Salary
A single mercenary can be employed for 100 credits per day. A mercenary squad of 10 marines can be conscripted for 600 credits per day for a minimum of 1 week, or 1000 credits per day otherwise.

### Combat Mechanics

Mercenary squads roll initiative as a group with no initiative bonus. If a mercenary takes damage they must make a damage saving throw:

1-5: Instantly Dead.

6-10: Gravely injured. The mercenary is unconscious and must be stabilized before the end of combat.

11-15: Slightly injured. The mercenary can continue the fight, but must retreat at the end of the encounter.

16-20: Flesh wound. The mercenary can continue fighting.

Cover: If hit while behind cover, mercenaries gain +5 to damage saving throws.

Saving Throws: If an attack requires a saving throw, the mercenary gets +2 to the roll.

#### Marine

Armor Class: 11

Speed: 30

Attack: Rail Rifle. +2 to hit, 1d8 piercing damage.

### Marauder

Armor Class: 10

Speed: 35

Attack: Pulse Axe. +2 to hit, 1d10 slashing damage.

#### Leadership Inspiration

With the Inspiring Leader feat, your squad of marines gain +2 to initiative rolles, and +2 to Armor Class. This bonus only applies to marines directly under your command.

## Conditions

---

Conditions alter a creature’s capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a tek skill, a class feature, a monster’s attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous.

A condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.

If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition’s effects don’t get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn’t.

The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a condition.

### Blinded
* A blinded creature can’t see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.
* Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage.

### Charmed
* A charmed creature can’t attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or tek effects.
* The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.

### Deafened
* A deafened creature can’t hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing.

### Exhaustion

Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect’s description.

| Level | Effect                                         |
|-------|------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Disadvantage on ability checks                 |
| 2     | Speed halved                                   |
| 3     | Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws |
| 4     | Hit point maximum halved                       |
| 5     | Speed reduced to 0                             |
| 6     | Death                                          |

If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect’s description.

A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.

An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect’s description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature’s exhaustion level is reduced below 1.

Finishing a long rest reduces a creature’s exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.

### Frightened
* A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.
* The creature can’t willingly move closer to the source of its fear.

### Grappled

* The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated (see the condition).
* The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the *concussive-wave* tek skill.

### Incapacitated
* An incapacitated creature can’t take actions or reactions.

### Invisible
* An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of tek or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature’s location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.
* Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have advantage.

### Paralyzed
* A paralyzed creature is incapacitated (see the condition) and can’t move or speak.
* The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
* Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
* Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.

* The creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can’t move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.
* Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
* The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
* The creature has resistance to all damage.
* The creature is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized.

### Poisoned
* A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

\page

### Prone
* A prone creature’s only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.
* The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.
* An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.

### Restrained
* A restrained creature’s speed becomes 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed.
* Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage.
* The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.

* The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
* Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.

### Unconscious
