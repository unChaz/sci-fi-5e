# Introduction

Sci-5 is a science fiction expansion of the 5th edition Dungeons and Dragons System Reference Document. In this document you will find all the re-flavoring you'll need to run a D&D campaign set in a sci-fi setting.

## Genre
Sci-5 is a Weird West, Hard Science Fiction sci-fi mixed with the Science Fantasy sub genre. All human created technology is somewhat realistic-- no time travel, no faster than light travel, no beaming. The origin of all fantasy aspects of Sci-5 is alien technology that is not fully understood and indistinguishable from magic.

### Space Wars
Space battles are meant to be more realistic than what you might see in Star Wars. Small fighters don't zip around each other as if in atmospheric flight. Space battles are short. They either end in a large silent explosion, or forced entry to a boarding party (the latter being the most desired outcome). Space battles are never huge fleet-on-fleet engagements. Space is big, ships are expensive, and sending a fleet away from home is foolish. Space wars are fought with subversion, manipulation, and politics. Freelancers are often the scalpel nations and corporations use to wage war on another, not in large battles, but through stealthy incursions, and hacked datacenters.

## Transhumanism
Transhumanism is referring to the belief or theory that the human race can evolve beyond its current physical and mental limitations, especially by means of science and technology. It is applied in this setting to the existence of EGO technology which allows humans to maintain a copy of their consciousness to be uploaded into a new body upon their death. It also opens up the possibilities for instantaneous interplanetary travel, and alternate mechanics for character resurrection. With the separation of EGO and body ("Skin"), you must consider ability scores. If a player were to have their EGO uploaded to a new body, the new Skin might not be as strong, agile, or as attractive as their original body. Therefore ability scores have been split into 2 categories, with the introduction of a few new ones.

### EGO
Each human is given an "EGO" that is installed at the base of the neck connected to your spinal cord. The EGO contains a complete record of your conscious mind. In the event of your death you can obtain a new body. Additionally, traveling across the solar system has never been faster with the ability to stream your EGO backup to a different body. If you have the funds, you can even have a cloned body ready for you on the other side.

If your EGO is destroyed however, there is no bringing you back. That is called "true death". The punishment for murder has been lessened with the exception of those who have religious encoding specifying they do not wish to be spun back up.

Having two copies or more of the same EGO is illegal under most governing bodies, and is punishable by true death.

It is also possible to enter into a totally virtual environment via the EGO. Using this method we can spin up a virtual instance of a person in VR to question them about their death, or keep prisoners inside a virtual environment indefinitely.

##### EGO Ability Scores
| Ability Score | Description |
|:----:|:-------------|
| Wit  | Mental sharpness and inventiveness; keen intelligence. |
| Fortitude  | Courage in pain or adversity. This is the mind's ability to resist tek effects, and mental stress. |
| Intelligence | The ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills. |
| Wisdom | Experience, knowledge, and good judgment. |

### Skin

A "Skin" is what the human body is now commonly referred to. Upon death, if your EGO is recovered, you can purchase a new Skin, or be provided a new one if you are properly insured. With the availability of Skin, age, gender, and physiology is just a temporary state. A mortal injury, or life threatening illness is just a financial concern to overcome.

##### Skin Ability Scores
| Ability Score | Description |
|:----:|:-------------|
|Strength |Physical strength |
|Dexterity | Agility, reflex, and balance |
|Physique | Beauty, appearance |
|Constitution | Overall health |

### Modified Ability Scores

#### Constitution
Constitution is merely a physical attribute. Fortitude is its mental counterpart. Together they make up your ability to resist physical pain. Your hit points, and constitution saving throws are calculated based on the highest between fortitude and constitution.

#### Charisma
Charisma is split into Physique and Wit. Charisma is calculated as the highest of the two. Whichever ability is your highest-- wit or physique, determines how you use those abilities. Some skills require one or the other. For example, deception uses wit whereas charm uses physique.

## Magic
The discovery of alien technology has led to the ability for humans to obtain seemingly supernatural powers. Classes in the Sci-5 class guide have been re-flavored to utilize technology instead of magic. Magic users such as arcanists (wizards) are not common in this setting.

### Tek Arcana
Tek Arcana is the term that refers to the use of alien technology to produce effects that we cannot understand scientifically. Those who study Tek Arcana are called Arcanists, and those that tinker with alien devices are called Artificers.

### Tekcaster
The tekcaster is a device worn on the wrist and is connected to the fingers. Using a combination of hand movements, vocal commands, and material components, the tekcaster can be used to cast tek skills. The tekcaster uses a gemstone as its power source. Depending on the requirements of the tek skill, the gem may be destroyed and must be replaced. Some tek skills require better quality gems.

```
```

>### Flavoring Spells
> Any 5e spell can be easily translated using the following steps:
> - Remove trivial material spell components that are not gems and do not have a monetary value.
> - Convert remaining non-gem material components to gems.
> - Remove supernatural references and replace with alien references.
> - Add sci-fi flavor as you see fit.

<br><br>

### Built-in Tekcasting
It is possible for one to cast tek skills without a conventional tekcaster. Synthetic Skins can have built in tekcasters, however the requirement for a gem as a power source still stands. Humans can also be fitted with a bionic arm that has a built in tekcaster.

## Weapons

#### Ion Weapons

Bladed weapons forged with modern day technology are much stronger than their iron ansestors. Their molecular structure makes them better for getting through weaker pulse armor.

#### Pulse Weapons

Powered melee weapons designed to pierce through modern armor. Especially effective against pulse armor.

#### Scorcher
A pistol that fires superheated metal.

### New Weapon Properties

Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.


**_Burst-Fire._** Weapons with this trait fire multiple rounds of ammunition per round. You roll once to hit, but roll damage separately for each round of ammunition.

**_Loading._** Weapons with this trait need to be reloaded after firing a certain number of times. For example a Rail Rifle fires 3 rounds of ammunition per round, and requires to be reloaded every 10 attacks, meaning its clips hold 30 rounds of ammunition.

**_Hidden._** This weapon can be disguised as an ordinary object with a Stealth check. It takes a bonus action to unsheathe.

## Armor

The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor worn in futuristic gaming worlds.

**_Armor Proficiency._** Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap A Pulse Shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor's use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't cast tek skills.

**_Armor Class (AC)._** Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class.

**_Heavy Armor._** Heavier armor interferes with the wearer's ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows “Str 13” or “Str 15” in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the wearer's speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.

**_Stealth._** If the Armor table shows “Disadvantage” in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

**_Pulse Shields._** A Pulse Shields is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding A Pulse Shields increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.

#### Light Armor

Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.

**_scarab skin._** Lightweight metal lined combat armor.

**_Pulse Armor._** Powered by a small generator, this expensive shielding deflects projectiles. Once depleted it takes time to recharge. Pulse armor can be quite expensive, but ideal if you are trying to keep a low profile.

#### Medium Armor

Medium armor offers more protection than light armor, but it also impairs movement more. If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.

**_flak armor._** Made of interlocking metal rings, a scarab skin is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This armor offers modest protection to the wearer's upper body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against one another to be muffled by outer layers.

**_Kevlar._** Basic military issue combat armor.

#### Heavy Armor

Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk.

Heavy armor doesn't let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn't penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative.

**_Power Shell._** Heavy and cumbersome, this powered mech armor gives the wearer enhanced strength, and a tough shell more resistant to damage than the standard pulse armor. However it makes it very difficult to be stealthy. This armor gives the wearer +2 Strength.

<div class='wide'>
##### Armor

| Name | Cost | Armor Class (AC) | Strength | Stealth | Weight | Don/Doff |
|--------------------|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|--------|----------|
| **_Light Armor_** | | | | | | |
| scarab skin | 4,500 credits | 12 + Dex modifier | — | — | 13 kg.| 1 minute|
| pulse armor | 20,000 credits | 13 + Dex modifier | — | — | 13 kg. | 1 action |
| **_Medium Armor_** | | | | | ||
| flak armor | 5,000 credits | 13 + Dex modifier (max 2) | — | — | 20 kg. |5/1 minutes|
| kevlar | 10,000 credits | 14 + Dex modifier (max 2) | — | Disadvantage | 45 kg. | 5/1 minutes|
| **_Heavy Armor_** | | | | | ||
| star shell | 150,000 credits | 18 | Str 5 | Disadvantage | 650 kg. |10/5 minutes |
| **_Shield_** | | | | | ||
| pulse shield | 50,000 credits | +2 | — | — | 6 kg. |1 action|


#### Getting Into and Out of Armor

The time it takes to don or doff armor depends on the armor's category.

**_Don._** This is the time it takes to put on armor. You benefit from the armor's AC only if you take the full time to don the suit of armor.

**_Doff._** This is the time it takes to take off armor. If you have help, reduce this time by half.

## Adventuring Gear

Below is a list of common freelancer gear.

**_Acid (vial)._** A strong acid that can melt through biological and metalic material. Takes 1d4 hours per inch of metal. A vial can cover enough surface area to create a hole big enough for up to 1 medium creature to fit through. When thrown on a creature, the creature must make a DC 14 dexterity save or take 2d6 acid damage.

**_Antitoxin._** A creature that injects this vial of liquid gains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to undead or synthetics.

**_Biomed Injector_** 50,000 credits. A creature with a Biomed Injector can program this device to automatically inject antitoxins, or medkits in certain scenarios. For example, you might pogram your Biomed Injector to inject a Medkit if your Hit Points go below half. This automatically uses your reaction. 

**_Caltrops._** As an action, you can spread a bag of caltrops to cover a square area that is 5 feet on a side. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving this turn and take 1 piercing damage. Taking this damage reduces the creature's walking speed by 10 feet until the creature regains at least 1 hit point. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn't need to make the save. Caltrops can be coated in poison to do additional damage.

**_Combat EVA Suit_** A piece of armor can be outfitted with retractable EVA components, and a low profile oxygen tank. As an action, you can enable the EVA mode. Helmet and gloves extend to cover the face and hands. The suit has enough oxygen for 4 hours.

**_Communicator_** An earpiece to use to communicate with squadmates. Has a range of 5 miles. Musut be occasionally recharged.

**_EVA Suit_** A spacesuit, helmet, and oxygen tank. Holds enough oxygen for a 4 hour EVA. The helmlet has a flashlight on it. Can automatically refill tank outside of a vacuum. Requires occasional recharging.

**_Datacube._** A cube 1 inch on each side that can store up to 1 zettabyte of information.

**_Datapad._** An all purpose personal digital assistant. Used for storing information, and accessing data networks. Also a required tool for hackers. A datapad can last up to 2 weeks before it needs to be charged over a long rest.

**_Datacuff._** A more expensive implementation of the personal digital assistant. Designed to wear around the wrist to keep your hands free when you are not using it. Has a touch screen and hologram interface.

**_Flashbang._** Throw at a location within 30 feet. Creatures within 5 feet must make a dexterity 14 saving throw or become blinded and defened until the end of their next turn.

**_Flashlight._** A flashlight casts bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. It's battery lasts 18 hours before needing to be recharged.

**_Flashlight Attachment._** A flashlight attachment can be magnetically attached to the side of most firearms.

**_Grappling Hook._** A small gas powered gun that fires a grappling hook up to 30 feet away. Can be connected to your belt, and can automatically be lowered up to 60 feet away from the hook. Requires a dexterity check with simple ranged weapons to accurately fire the hook.

**_Grenade._** Throw at a location within 30 feet. Creatures within 5 feet must make a dexterity 14 saving throw or take damage based on the grenade's type. Types: Incendiary (fire), Radiation (radiant), Cryo (cold), gas (poison)

**_Handcuffs_** These mechanical restraints can bind a Small or Medium creature. Escaping the handcuffs requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. Breaking them requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. Each set of handcuffs is linked to a secured datapad. This can be bypassed with a successful DC 15 hacking check. Handcuffs have 15 hit points.

**_Magboots._** Boots that magnetize to surface improving mobility in null-g environments. They must be activated with an action.

**Medkit._** This kit is a pouch containing synthetic flesh, salves, splints, antibiotics, and a defibrillator. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Medicine check. Medkit can also be used to triage an injured character if a character has the ability to do so.

**_Mess Kit._** This tin box contains a cup and simple cutlery. The box clamps together, and one side can be used as a cooking pan and the other as a plate or shallow bowl.

**Motion Sensor._** When you use your action to place this sensor, you are alerted when motion is detected within 30 feet in line of sight to the sensor.

**_Poison, Basic._** You can use the poison in this vial to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammunition must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying.

**_Potion of Healing._** A character who drinks the fluid in this vial regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. Drinking or administering a potion takes an action.

**_Rations._** Rations consist of dry foods suitable for extended space travel, including freeze dried meals.

**_Rope._** Rope, made of synthetic fibers, has 2 hit points and can be burst with a DC 17 Strength check.

**_Tekcaster._** Implement with which tek skills are cast.

**_Tent._** A simple and portable nylon shelter, a tent sleeps two. Has magnets so that it can be comfortably used in null-g.

Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to identify or mend wounds. Also, proficiency with this kit is required to create antitoxin and potions of healing.

### Musical Instrument

Several of the most common types of musical instruments are shown on the table as examples. If you have proficiency with a given musical instrument, you can add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to play music with the instrument. Each type of musical instrument requires a separate proficiency.

```
```

### Navigator's Datapad

This specialized datapad is used for navigation in space. Proficiency with navigator's tools lets you chart a ship's course and follow navigation charts. In addition, it allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make to avoid getting lost in space. In the event that a ship's navigation data is out of date or offline, you can override the navigation controls from the ship's helm using this device. You can update the star charts on your Navigator's Datapad at most colonies and stations.

Proficiency with these tools lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to disarm traps or pick physical locks as well as hack simple electronic locks.

## Currency Conversion

Currency is mostly dealt with in digital credits, however coins are still in circulation.

With one 100 credits, a character can buy a bedroll, 50 carbon fiber rope, or a low end datapad. A skilled (but not exceptional) worker can earn 100 credits a day.

50 credits buys a laborer's work for half a day, a night in a low end hostel, or a few rounds of drinks at a pub.

A single credit buys a pack of gum, small flashlight, or a bottle of water.

Coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp). Coin denominations are the same as standard D&D so it makes it easy to convert the value of goods and services.

<br>

**Standard Exchange Rates**

| Coin          | Credits |
|---------------|-------|
| Copper (cp)   | 1     |
| Silver (sp)   | 10    |
| Gold (gp)     | 100   |
| Platinum (pp) | 1,000 |

# Space Travel

## Ship Maneuvers

Space encounters should be kept simple, and contained in the theater of the mind. The players should know what their ship has at their disposal. You describe the situation, and the pilot describes the maneuver they wish to perform. They make a piloting check against a DC determined by the DM.

<br>

>### Short and Sweet
>Ship encounters should be short, simple, and cinematic. In this universe, the point of ship to ship combat is not to destroy, but commandeer enemy vessels. These huge ships take trillions of credits of wealth, and years to build. Squandering all that for an easy victory is generally considered foolish, and dishonorable.


#### Available Maneuvers

##### Match Velocity
Whether engaging an enemy vessel, rendevouzing with an ally, or just docking at a space station, you always have to match velocity first. This can be done in most cases without a roll, but if you are attempting to match velocity with a fleeing ship, you must make a (dexterity) piloting check. If a ship is actively evading you, your ship must be able to match the max thrust of the ship you are pursuing.

##### Rendevouz
Once you have matched velocity with another vessel, you must close the distance before docking. This can be done without a piloting check unless approaching an enemy, or alien vessel. The result of a successful rendevous is to be within range of a vessel or station to dock or fire weapons.

##### Dock
Docking is a trivial procedure in most cases, and won't require a roll. However, a ship under fire might be pressed to dock more rapidly, in which case a roll may be required.

##### Evasive Maneuvers
If under fire, and trying to escape, you can fly the ship evasively to avoid oncoming enemy fire. This action gives any attacking ship disadvantage on attack rolls.

##### Engage Cloak
If the ship contains any stealth technology, the pilot can make a dexterity (stealth) check. Until the cloak is disabled, enemy ships have disadvantage when making perception checks to detect you. Firing weapons will immediately break the cloak.

##### Boarding
If you need to force entry into a vessel or station, you must make the boarding maneuver. Roll a piloting check against the AC of the enemy vessel. You have advantage if the ship's hull is at half HP, or if the vessel is unaware of your presence.

```
```

##### Fire Weapons
If attacking a ship of similar size or smaller, the ships weapons can be fired effectively. Size differences in ships are so great that a smaller ship's weapons would have little effect against a larger ship unless the larger ship was severely outnumbered.

To fire weapons you must be in range of the enemy vessel through a successful rendevouz maneuver.

You then must target a specific subsystem of the ship.

### Ship Subsystems
Each subsystem has the same AC and HP. A subsystem is disabled at half HP, and destroyed at 0.

#### Life Support
By disabling or destroying this system, you've emptied the ship of breathable air. Keep in mind that this does not affect anyone aboard the ship wearing an EVA suit. A disabled life support system can be repaired by an engineer within a few days without going into dry dock. A destroyed life support system must be replaced.

#### Engineering
By disabling engineering, you render the ship propulsion useless. This may be desirable for a fleeing ship. Like life support systems, it can be repaird in a few days. Destroying engineering causes a chain reaction that will tear apart the entire vessel.

#### Weapons
If you disable weapons systems the ship will not be able to make the attack action. Destroyed weapons systems must be replaced in dry dock.

#### Hull
Dealing damage to the hull will make it easier to breach. Holes in the hull can be triaged by locking down certain sections of the ship to protect the rest of the ship from the vacuum of space. Destroyed hull means the destruction of the entire ship.

<br>
<br>

>##### Ship Repair
>An engineer can spend a day repairing a ship, and roll one of its hit die for a specific subsystem. Once a ship subsystem is above half HP, it is functional again. Certain subsystems can be repaired in flight. The propulsion systems, however, cannot be used while the engineering subsystem is being repaired. Also weapons cannot be fired on a day that is spent repairing the weapons systems.

### Cargo Vessels

Cargo vessels are usually categorized by size: small, medium, large. Cargo ships can range from 40m, to the massive 1km long ships. Cargo vesseles are also categorized by type. The most common types you will find are gas, ice, and container. Gas vessels often have massive gas tanks attached to the side. Ice haulers are usually a giant warehouse size box, with the crew cabins along the outside and the thrusters arranged around a single massive cargo bay door. Container vessels are either a long cylyndrical ship that attaches huge containers of goods on the outsides. Some cargo container ships have a large pressurized cargo housing, and cargo is loaded through docking ports.

### Effects of Acceleration
The human body was not made to handle high gravity acceleration. Prolongued exposure to high g can result in blacking out, physical injury, or even death. To determine how your body handles high gravity acceleration, you must make a Constitution saving throw.

The saving throw DC is equal to 10 plus the amount of excess gravity rounded up. For example, if the ship is moving at 2G, the DC would be 11.

If you fail, you fall unconscious for 10 minutes. You also might take damage based on how badly you failed.

##### Acceleration Damage
| Fail by | Damage Per Round |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 0-4  | 0 |
| 5-9  | 1d4 |
| 10-14 | 2d4 |
| 15-19 | 3d4 |
| 20+ | 4d4 |

Drugs may also be administered to protect you from prolongued exposure to high gravity acceleration.

<div class='wide'>
| Drug | Saving Throw Bonus | Bonus Effect | Withdrawl | Cost |
|:----:|:-------------|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| G-Serum  | +5 | none | none | 500c |
| Pilot Juice | +10 | Advantage on Pilot Checks for 10 minutes. | Disadvantage on Wisdom Ability Checks until you take a long rest.| 1,000c|
</div>

If you are not strapped into a proper seat or "crash couch", you make this roll with disadvantage as your body is thrown against the nearest bulkhead. You also take fall damage multiplied by the number of Gs. For example, if you are 10 feet away from the nearest bulkhead, and your pilot makes a maneuver at 4G, you take 4d6 fall damage.

\page
# Mercenary Squads

### Squad Combat

Whether you employ a squad of mercenaries, or your organization has mercenaries in their service, having a squad of marines at your back is essential for many types of incursions. A group of marines can be broken up into any number of squads, but each squad will only take orders from 1 PC leader.

Mercenaries are expendable soldiers that can make or break any combat engagement. Many mercenaries have EGO insurance ensuring that if they are killed in battle, they will receive a new Skin. Real death is rare among mercenaries, and most will avoid aiming for the EGO of a fellow mercenary as honor demands.

Mercenaries do well against other mercenaries and weaker foes, but against a more formidable foe, such as a razor wielding lancer, they will be torn apart.

### Mercenary Salary
Mercenaries should be too expensive to keep around full time. Rather they should be employed in specific scenarios. Mercenary pay should scale with level. If the party's' benifactor supplies squads of marines, they might only supply them on missions that call for it.

### Combat Mechanics

Mercenary squads roll initiative as a group with no initiative bonus. A PC squad leader can give orders to their squad with a bonus action. The squad will continue to follow that order until told differently. You can specify specific members of the squad with the order. Other squad members will continue with their previous orders. For example, if a squad is ordered to attack the enemy, they are intellgient enough to seek a new target when their target has been taken out. Mercenaries can be considered NPCs per the DM's discression. It may make combat move more quickly if you want to simplify the PC involvement to just giving orders.

### Taking Damage
When a mercenary takes damage from an attack, they must make a saving throw with a DC equal to the amount of damage taken. On a failed save, the mercenary is a casualty, and cannot continue fighting.

### Recovering Casualties
If you are able to recover casualties after combat, for each mercenary casualty roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, the mercenary can recover over a long rest. On a failure, the mercenary was not able to be saved, but their EGO can be recovered. Some mercenary companies might charge a fee for lost or destroyed mercenary EGOs, and expect you to recover EGOs of those that fall in battle.

### Leadership Inspiration

With the Inspiring Leader feat, your squad of marines gain +2 to initiative rolls, and +2 to Armor Class. This bonus only applies to mercenaries directly under your command.

## Hacking

### Types of Networks

#### SIGNET

The Solar Interplanetary Gateway Network, or SIGNET is a data network that provides FTL communication via quantum broadband network hubs. These hubs are highly secured by the system government. Hackers avoid going through SIGNET and prefer on site hacking. An intruder breaking into a system through SIGNET is easily tracked.

SIGNET hubs are accessible wherever system government can be found-- government controlled worlds, and space stations. Many large corporations and factions that are in the good graces of the government and have their own SIGNET hubs.

#### VPN

A Virtual Private Network is a network of datapads that can exchange encrypted communications. Only datapads that have been added by the system administrator can decrypt any information passed over that network. A VPN is a common security protocol used by corporations and is considered legal. Due to the nature of Virtual Private Networks, the data and identity of its users are anonymous to outside observers. This makes it possible for criminal organizations to use a VPN to communicate secretly over SIGNET. The only downside is, that if you want to add someone to a VPN, the safest way to do so is in person.

##### Setting up a VPN

Setting up a VPN takes a full day of hacking. You must acquire server space, and secure the system. Server space is a one time fee of 2,500 credits for 1 zettabyte of data, and an additional 500 credits per zettabyte. One zettabyte is enough for your crew to store a communications database, and a file server with enough space for a relatively small amount of data.

After purchasing your server and spending a day setting up your server. At the end of the day you must make a DC 12 intelligence (hacking) check. If you succeed, the network is set up, and you can proceed to securing the network (see below). If you fail, you can attempt to spend another day of hacking and make the check again. Since you have already paid to allocate the server, you do not have to pay for server space again unless you wish to set up a different network. There is no limit on how many networks you set up, as long as you pay a separate server setup fee for each.  

Each VPN will have an automatically generated base64 encoded random string identifier, but you can come up with an alias to make it easier to know what network you are connected to.

>### Network Monitoring
>Having a hacker actively monitoring a network for intruders allows you to add their intelligence (hacking) modifier to the network's security protocol DC.

### Breaking Into a System

Breaking into a system is a three step process.

#### Step 1: Secure a Connection
First you must have a connection to the network. If the network is connected to SIGNET, this is easy if the network has a public front. If it doesn't you must find a lead. You can discover a point of entry by either monitoring the traffic of someones datapad via packet sniffing, or analyze a stolen datapad. Hacking through DARKNET is not viable due to the slow response time. If the network is not connected to SIGNET, you must hack in person. A direct connection to the network can be made through any of its connected devices. A security network can be connected to through a security camera, door access panel, a disabled defense turret, engineering access panel, or any device connected to the network.

##### Packet Sniffing
A hacker's datapad can scan for packets being transmitted to and from a target device. You must be within 30 feet of the device. Due to encryption, you cannot see the contents of the data, but you can trace the destination of packets to determine the network they are connected to. Make a hacker check with the DC = 10 + the user's hacking modifier. On a success, while monitoring them you can determine the network they are connecting to. On a failure, make a dexterity (stealth) check to see if you were noticed.

#### Step 2: Bypass Security Protocol
Breaking security protocol requires 1 minute, and a successful intelligence (hacking) check against the network's security protocol DC. The level of access you gain depends on the result of the roll.

##### Intrusion Level
The level of access you gain is equal to the intrusion level.

**Intrusion Level = result of the hacking check - security protocol DC**

Once the intrusion level is calculated, you compare it to the security protocol table of the network to determine what systems you have access to. See example security protocol tables below.

#### Step 3: Hide You Tracks
Once you have broken in, make a (dexterity) stealth check to avoid being detected for every minute you are connected. The longer you are connected, the higher chance of detection. If the network is being monitored, system administrators may be alerted to your presence if you are not careful. Also, if you leave any traces behind, system administrators might find evidence the were hacked. If you're careful enough, you can get in and get out, leaving them none the wiser.


### Taking Control
If you gain intrusion level 5 (administrator) access to a network, and have a security protocol script available (see below), you can spend 10 minutes to take control of the system, and lock out any other users. This automatically alerts system administrators to your presence.

#### Adding a datapad to a VPN

All you need to do to add a datapad to a VPN is give them the access codes, and add their public key to the VPN authorized user registry. You can set up a handshake script when setting up the VPN, so all you need to do is link the datapad to yours, and run the connection script. Once the owner confirms the connection, they will have access to the VPN. You can deny them access at any point by removing them from the authorized user registry.

### DARKNET

DARKNET is a broadband mesh network that, unlike SIGNET, is limited by the speed of light. One downside is DARKNET has a response time ranging between 10 minutes and 3 hours (depending on the time of year and the client/host locations). DARKNET is primarily viable for transferring illegal information, or things you want to keep from the prying eyes of the government.

Those who know how to access to DARKNET include Scoundrels and Cybernetics, or anyone with the Criminal/Spy, Smuggler, or Hacker background.

### Security Network

Security networks control doors, cameras, defense systems for a building, space station, or base. Below is a general security scheme. However, some sysadmins may put certain network functions on higher access levels.

<div style="text-align:center">
** Security Protocol Table (security network)**

| Intrusion Level | Access                             |
|-----------------|------------------------------------|
| 0               | View Network Functions             |
| 1               | View Security Cameras              |
| 2               | Door and Lighting Control          |
| 3               | Disable Cameras or Defense Systems |
| 4               | Control Defense Systems            |
| 5               | Administrator Access               |

</div>

### Data Network

A data network is just a file server that may contain anything from emails, documents, plans, blueprints, or faction intel. Once you gain access to a data network, you can download any file that your level of access permits. Data networks have user based permission schemas. When you break in, level 1 intrusion will allow you to impersonate a specific user on that network, and have access to everything they have access to. Admin intrusion gives you access to all the data on the network.

<div style="text-align:center">
** Security Protocol Table (data network)**

| Intrusion Level | Access
|-----------------|--------
| 0               | View Network Users           |
| 1               | Level 1 Users Impersonation  |
| 2               | Level 2 Users Impersonation  |
| 3               | Level 3 Users Impersonation  |
| 4               | Level 4 Users Impersonation  |
| 5               | Administrator Access         |

</div>

## Securing a System

The security of a network or system is only as good as its system administrator. Basic security protocol gives a system a DC of 12. A network that you use your own security protocol on has a DC = 10 + your hacking modifier. All networks come with default security protocol, but you can spend a day implementing your own security protocol.

#### Security Protocol Script
You can also generate a security protocol script on your databad. Spend a day hacking, and at the end of the day succeed a DC 12 intelligence (hacking) check, and your script is created. From then on, you can spend 10 minutes running the script on a system you control, and your security protocol will be implemented with you as the sysadmin. If at any point your hacking modifier increases, you must rewrite the script using the same process.

## Large Data Files
Unless you are storing the large files below, generally a file server that is 1zb is large enough to last a typical frelancer group a year before needing to be expanded.

<div style="text-align:center">
| Data Type          | Data Size     |
|--------------------|---------------|
| VR Quality Video   | .1zb per hour |
| 1000 Intel         | 1zb           |
| EGO Backup       | 10zb          |
|
  </div>

##### EGO Backup
an EGO backup is the largest single data item. A single EGO backup takes up 10zb of data. Backups must be processed through SIGNET to avoid packet loss which could lead to corrupted backups. Backing up also requires the highest speed SIGNET connection, and takes 10 minutes.

##### VR Video File
VR video not only contains visual and audio, but all the components required to recreate a completely immersive VR experience. VR might either be captured directly from EGO memory, or a specialized VR capture device. Either way, the files created are quite large.

>## Faction Intel
>Faction Intel is encrypted data about the organization that you hacked. This can be sold annonymously on DARKNET for credits at a 1:1 ratio. You can also spend 1 day per 100 intel with a successsful DC 12 intelligence (hacking) check to decrypt the data. Decrypted intel will give you valuable information about the organization that you can leverage for a mission. The larger the amount of intel decrypted, the better the information is yielded. Alternatively you can trade intel with an opposing faction to make a point of contact within that faction, or increase your reputation within that faction.
