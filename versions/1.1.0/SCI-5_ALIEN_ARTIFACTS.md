## Rare and Tek Items

---

Tek items are presented in alphabetical order. A alien artifact's description gives the item's name, its category, its rarity, and its tek properties.

### Adamantine Armor

_Armor (medium or heavy, but not hide), uncommon_

This suit of armor modified to fit humans is reinforced with adamantine, one of the hardest substances found in the solar system. While you're wearing it, any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit.

### Ammunition, +1, +2, or +3

_Weapon (any ammunition), uncommon (+1), rare (+2), or very rare (+3)_

You have a bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this piece of tek ammunition. The bonus is determined by the rarity of the ammunition. Once recycled, the ammunition loses this property.

### Amulet of Health

_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)_

Your Constitution score is 19 while you wear this amulet. It has no effect on you if your Constitution is already 19 or higher.

### Amulet of Proof against Detection and Location

_Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)_

While wearing this amulet, you are hidden from divination tek. You can't be targeted by such tek or perceived through tek scrying sensors.

### Amulet of the Planes

_Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)_

While wearing this amulet, you can use an action to name a location that you are familiar with on another plane of existence. Then make a DC 15 Intelligence check. On a successful check, you cast the _plane shift_ tek skill. On a failure, you and each creature and object within 15 feet of you travel to a random destination. Roll a d100. On a 1–60, you travel to a random location on the plane you named. On a 61–100, you travel to a randomly determined plane of existence.

### Levitating Shield

_Armor (shield), very rare (requires attunement)_

While holding this shield, you can speak its command word as a bonus action to cause it to levitate. The shield leaps into the air and hovers in your space to protect you as if you were wielding it, leaving your hands free. The shield remains animated for 1 minute, until you use a bonus action to end this effect, or until you are incapacitated or die, at which point the shield falls to the ground or into your hand if you have one free.

### Crab Crawler

_Wondrous item, legendary_

This item first appears to be a Large sealed iron barrel weighing 500 pounds. The barrel when activated expands into a vehicle that can crawl on metallic surfaces, and has a minimal propulsion system.

The Crab Crawler is a Large object with the following statistics:

**Armor Class:** 20

**Hit Points:** 200

**Speed:** 30 ft., propulsion 30 ft.

**Damage Immunities:** poison, psychic

To be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus's hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.

The apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute from pressure.

### Armor, +1, +2, or +3

_Armor (light, medium, or heavy), rare (+1), very rare (+2), or legendary (+3)_

You have a bonus to AC while wearing this armor. The bonus is determined by its rarity.

### Armor of Invulnerability

_Armor (plate), legendary (requires attunement)_

You have resistance to nontek damage while you wear this armor. Additionally, you can use an action to make yourself immune to nontek damage for 10 minutes or until you are no longer wearing the armor. Once this special action is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

### Armor of Resistance

_Armor (light, medium, or heavy), rare (requires attunement)_

You have resistance to one type of damage while you wear this armor. The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly from the options below.

| d10 | Damage Type |
|-----|-------------|
| 1   | Acid        |
| 2   | Cold        |
| 3   | Fire        |
| 4   | Force       |
| 5   | Shock   |
| 6   | Radiation    |
| 7   | Poison      |
| 8   | Psychic     |
| 9   | Radiant     |
| 10  | Concussive     |

### Armor of Vulnerability

_Armor (plate), rare (requires attunement)_

While wearing this armor, you have resistance to one of the following damage types: bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly.

**_Hack_**. This armor is hacked, a fact that is revealed only when an _identify_ tek skill is cast on the armor or you attune to it. Attuning to the armor hacks you until you are targeted by the _remove hack_ tek skill or similar tek; removing the armor fails to end the hack. While hacked, you have vulnerability to two of the three damage types associated with the armor (not the one to which it grants resistance).

### Bullet-Catching Shield

_Armor (shield), rare (requires attunement)_

You gain a +2 bonus to AC against ranged attacks while you wield this shield. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC. In addition, whenever an attacker makes a ranged attack against a target within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to become the target of the attack instead.

### Bullet of Slaying

_Weapon (bullet), very rare_

An _bullet of slaying_ is a tek weapon meant to slay a particular kind of creature. Some are more focused than others; for example, there are both _bullets of robot slaying_ and _bullets of abberation slaying_. If a creature belonging to the type, race, or group associated with an _bullet of slaying_ takes damage from the bullet, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one.

Once an _bullet of slaying_ deals its extra damage to a creature, it becomes a nontek bullet.


### Bag of Devouring

_Wondrous item, very rare_

This bag superficially resembles a _bag of holding_ but is a feeding orifice for a gigantic extradimensional creature. Turning the bag inside out closes the orifice.

The extradimensional creature attached to the bag can sense whatever is placed inside the bag. Animal or vegetable matter placed wholly in the bag is devoured and lost forever. When part of a living creature is placed in the bag, as happens when someone reaches inside it, there is a 50 percent chance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A creature inside the bag can use its action to try to escape with a successful DC 15 Strength check. Another creature can use its action to reach into the bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength check (provided it isn't pulled inside the bag first). Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag is devoured, its body destroyed.

Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which can hold a cubic foot of such material. However, once each day, the bag swallows any objects inside it and spits them out into another dimension. The GM determines the time and dimension.

If the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and anything contained within it is transported to a random location on the Astral Plane.

### Bag of Holding

_Wondrous item, uncommon_

This bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action.

If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.

Placing a _bag of holding_ inside an extradimensional space created by a _handy haversack_, _portable hole_, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.

### Grenade of Force

_Wondrous item, rare_

This small black spherical device measures 3/4 of an inch in diameter and weighs an ounce. Typically, 1d4 + 4 _grenades of force_ are found together.

You can use an action to throw the grenade up to 60 feet. The grenade explodes on impact and is destroyed. Each creature within a 10-foot radius of where the grenade landed must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 5d4 force damage. A sphere of transparent force then encloses the area for 1 minute. Any creature that failed the save and is completely within the area is trapped inside this sphere. Creatures that succeeded on the save, or are partially within the area, are pushed away from the center of the sphere until they are no longer inside it. Only breathable air can pass through the sphere's wall. No attack or other effect can.

An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere's wall, moving the sphere up to half the creature's walking speed. The sphere can be picked up, and its tek causes it to weigh only 1 pound, regardless of the weight of creatures inside.

### Exoskeleton

_Wondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement)_

This rare device is worn inside your armor. While wearing this suit, your Strength score changes to a score granted by the suit. If your Strength is already equal to or greater than the suit's score, the item has no effect on you.

Six varieties of this belt exist, corresponding with and having rarity according to the six kinds of true giants. The _v of stone giant strength_ and the _suit of frost giant strength_ look different, but they have the same effect.

| Type              | Strength | Rarity    |
|-------------------|----------|-----------|
| Hill giant        | 21       | Rare      |
| Stone/frost giant | 23       | Very rare |
| Fire giant        | 25       | Very rare |
| Cloud giant       | 27       | Legendary |
| Storm giant       | 29       | Legendary |

### Berserker Axe

_Weapon (pulse axe), rare (requires attunement)_

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this pulse tek weapon. In addition, while you are attuned to this weapon, your hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained.

**_Hack_**. This pulse axe is hacked, and becoming attuned to it extends the hack to you. As long as you remain hacked, you are unwilling to part with the axe, keeping it within reach at all times. You also have disadvantage on attack rolls with weapons other than this one, unless no foe is within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear.

Whenever a hostile creature damages you while the pulse axe is in your possession, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or go berserk. While berserk, you must use your action each round to attack the creature nearest to you with the pulse axe. If you can make extra attacks as part of the Attack action, you use those extra attacks, moving to attack the next nearest creature after you fell your current target. If you have multiple possible targets, you attack one at random. You are berserk until you start your turn with no creatures within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear.

### Boots of Speed

_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)_

While you wear these boots, you can use a bonus action and click the boots' heels together. If you do, the boots double your walking speed, and any creature that makes an opportunity attack against you has disadvantage on the attack roll. If you click your heels together again, you end the effect.

When the boots' property has been used for a total of 10 minutes, the tek ceases to function until you finish a long rest.

### Boots of Striding and Springing

_Wondrous item, rare_

This is a tek enhanced wrist cuff. While wearing it, you can use it to cast the _dimension door_ tek skill as an action. This property of the cuff can't be used again until the next dawn.

When you disappear, you leave behind a cloud of smoke, and you appear in a similar cloud of smoke at your destination. The smoke lightly obscures the space you left and the space you appear in, and it dissipates at the end of your next turn. A light or stronger wind disperses the smoke.

### Hoverboard

_Wondrous item, very rare_

You can activate the hoverboard as an action to make the it hover and fly. It is controlled by shifting weight and tracking specific foot movements.

Four sizes of _hoverboard_ exist. The GM chooses the size of a given hoverboard or determines it randomly.

| d100   | Size          | Capacity | Flying Speed |
|--------|---------------|----------|--------------|
| 01–20  | 3 ft. × 5 ft. | 200 kg.  | 80 feet      |
| 21–55  | 4 ft. × 6 ft. | 400 kg.  | 60 feet      |

| 81–100 | 6 ft. × 9 ft. | 800 kg.  | 30 feet      |

A hoverboard can carry up to twice the weight shown on the table, but it flies at half speed if it carries more than its normal capacity.

### Remote of Opening

This handheld remote has a single button. While pointing it at an object within 120 feet of you that can be opened, such as a door, lid, or lock. the remote issues a clear tone, and one lock or latch on the object opens unless the signal can't reach the object.

The remote can be used ten times. After the tenth time, it runs out of energy and becomes useless.

### Visor of Blasting

_Wondrous item, uncommon_

*requires a tekcaster*

### Jumpsuit  of Arachnida

_Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)_

* You can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free.
* You can't be caught in webs of any sort and can move through webs as if they were difficult terrain.
* You can use an action to cast the _web_ tek skill (save DC 13). The web created by the tek skill fills twice its normal area. Alternatively you can send a rope of webbing to a target within 30 feet that you can see. Until the rope is dismissed, as a bonus action you can reel in the web. If the target is smaller than you, it is pulled to you. If the target is larger, you are pulled to it up to a distance of 30 feet. Until the rope is dismissed, you cannot use the hand it is connected to for anything else. You can dismiss the rope with a free action. Once used, this property of the suit must recharge and can't be used again until the next dawn.

### Necklace of Displacement

_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)_

While you wear this necklace, it projects an illusion that makes you appear to be standing in a place near your actual location, causing any creature to have disadvantage on attack rolls against you.

### Ghost Cloak

You can use an action to press one of the cube's faces, expending a number of charges based on the chosen face, as shown in the Cube of Force Faces table. Each face has a different effect. If the cube has insufficient charges remaining, nothing happens. Otherwise, a barrier of invisible force springs into existence, forming a cube 15 feet on a side. The barrier is centered on you, moves with you, and lasts for 1 minute, until you use an action to press the cube's sixth face, or the cube runs out of charges. You can change the barrier's effect by pressing a different face of the cube and expending the requisite number of charges, resetting the duration.

If your movement causes the barrier to come into contact with a solid object that can't pass through the cube, you can't move any closer to that object as long as the barrier remains.

**Cube of Force Faces (table)**

| Face | Charges | Effect                                                                                                            |
|------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | 1       | Gases, wind, and fog can't pass through the barrier.                                                              |
| 2    | 2       | Nonliving matter can't pass through the barrier. Walls, floors, and ceilings can pass through at your discretion. |
| 3    | 3       | Living matter can't pass through the barrier.                                                                     |
| 4    | 4       | Tek effects can't pass through the barrier.                                                                     |
| 5    | 5       | Nothing can pass through the barrier. Walls, floors, and ceilings can pass through at your discretion.            |
| 6    | 0       | The barrier deactivates.                                                                                          |

The cube loses charges when the barrier is targeted by certain tek skills or comes into contact with certain tek skill or alien artifact effects, as shown in the table below.

### Ion Dagger of Reaper

_Weapon (ion dagger), rare_

### Dancing Sword

_Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)_

You can use a bonus action to toss this tek sword into the air and speak the command word. When you do so, the sword begins to hover, flies up to 30 feet, and attacks one creature of your choice within 5 feet of it. The sword uses your attack roll and ability score modifier to damage rolls.

While the sword hovers, you can use a bonus action to cause it to fly up to 30 feet to another spot within 30 feet of you. As part of the same bonus action, you can cause the sword to attack one creature within 5 feet of it.

After the hovering sword attacks for the fourth time, it flies up to 30 feet and tries to return to your hand. If you have no hand free, it falls to the ground at your feet. If the sword has no unobstructed path to you, it moves as close to you as it can and then falls to the ground. It also ceases to hover if you grasp it or move more than 30 feet away from it.

### Defender

_Weapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunement)_

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this tek weapon.

The first time you attack with the sword on each of your turns, you can transfer some or all of the sword's bonus to your Armor Class, instead of using the bonus on any attacks that turn. For example, you could reduce the bonus to your attack and damage rolls to +1 and gain a +2 bonus to AC. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn, although you must hold the sword to gain a bonus to AC from it.

### Demon Armor

_Armor (plate), very rare (requires attunement)_

While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. In addition, the armor's clawed gauntlets turn unarmed strikes with your hands into tek weapons that deal slashing damage, with a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls and a damage die of 1d8.

**_Hack_**. Once you don this hacked armor, you can't doff it unless you are targeted by the _remove hack_ tek skill or similar tek. While wearing the armor, you have disadvantage on saving throws against tek skills.

### Dragon Kevlar

_Armor (kevlar), very rare (requires attunement)_

Dragon kevlar is made of the scales of one kind of dragon. Sometimes dragons collect their cast-off scales and gift them to humanoids. Other times, hunters carefully skin and preserve the hide of a dead dragon. In either case, dragon kevlar is highly valued.

While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, you have advantage on saving throws against the Frightful Presence and breath weapons of dragons, and you have resistance to one damage type that is determined by the kind of dragon that provided the scales (see the table).

Additionally, you can focus your senses as an action to discern the distance and direction to the closest dragon within 30 miles of you that is of the same type as the armor. This special action can't be used again until the next dawn.

| Dragon | Resistance |
|--------|------------|
| Black  | Acid       |
| Blue   | Shock  |
| Brass  | Fire       |
| Bronze | Shock  |
| Copper | Acid       |
| Gold   | Fire       |
| Green  | Poison     |
| Red    | Fire       |
| Silver | Cold       |
| White  | Cold       |

### Dragon Slayer

_Weapon (any sword), rare_

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this tek weapon.

When you hit a dragon with this weapon, the dragon takes an extra 3d6 damage of the weapon's type. For the purpose of this weapon, “dragon” refers to any creature with the dragon type, including dragon turtles and wyverns.

### Dust of Disappearance

_Wondrous item, uncommon_

Found in a small packet, this powder resembles very fine sand. There is enough of it for one use. When you use an action to throw the dust into the air, you and each creature and object within 10 feet of you become invisible for 2d4 minutes. The duration is the same for all subjects, and the dust is consumed when its tek takes effect. If a creature affected by the dust attacks or casts a tek skill, the invisibility ends for that creature.

### Dust of Dryness

_Wondrous item, uncommon_

This small packet contains 1d6 + 4 pinches of dust. You can use an action to sprinkle a pinch of it over water. The dust turns a cube of water 15 feet on a side into one marble-sized pellet, which floats or rests near where the dust was sprinkled. The pellet's weight is negligible.

Someone can use an action to smash the pellet against a hard surface, causing the pellet to shatter and release the water the dust absorbed. Doing so ends that pellet's tek.

An elemental composed mostly of water that is exposed to a pinch of the dust must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 radiation damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Dust of Sneezing and Choking

_Wondrous item, uncommon_

Found in a small container, this powder resembles very fine sand. It appears to be _dust of disappearance_, and an _identify_ tek skill reveals it to be such. There is enough of it for one use.

When you use an action to throw a handful of the dust into the air, you and each creature that needs to breathe within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become unable to breathe, while sneezing uncontrollably. A creature affected in this way is incapacitated and suffocating. As long as it is conscious, a creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on it on a success. The _lesser restoration_ tek skill can also end the effect on a creature.

### Light flak armor

_Armor (flak armor), rare_

You gain a +1 bonus to AC while you wear this armor. You are considered proficient with this armor even if you lack proficiency with medium armor.

### Bionic Eye

_Wondrous item, uncommon_

This crystal lens fits over the eye like a contact. While wearing it, you can see much better than normal out to a range of 1 foot. You have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks that rely on sight while inspecting tiny objects such as circuit boards or nanotechnology.

### Eyes of the Eagle

_Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)_

These contact lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing them, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. In conditions of clear visibility, you can make out details of even extremely distant creatures and objects as small as 2 feet across.

### Flame Tongue

_Weapon (any sword), rare (requires attunement)_

You can use a bonus action to speak this tek sword's command word, causing flames to erupt from the blade. These flames shed bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. While the sword is ablaze, it deals an extra 2d6 fire damage to any target it hits. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or sheathe the sword.

### Folding Shuttle

_Wondrous item, rare_

This is a box the size of a large suitcase. When activated it folds out into a miniature shuttle that can hold 2 passengers. It has enough oxygen for 10 hours, and a minor propulsion system that can accelerate up to .2g.

### Glamoured scarab skin

_Armor (scarab skin), rare_

While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. You can also use a bonus action to speak the armor's command word and cause the armor to project the image of a normal set of clothing or some other kind of armor. You decide what it looks like, including color, style, and accessories, but the armor retains its normal bulk and weight. The illusory appearance lasts until you use this property again or remove the armor.

### Gloves of Missile Snaring

_Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)_

These gloves seem to almost meld into your hands when you don them. When a _thrown_ weapon attack hits you while you're wearing them, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier, provided that you have a free hand. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in that hand.

### Gloves of Swimming and Climbing

While wearing these gloves, climbing and swimming don't cost you extra movement, and you gain a +5 bonus to Strength (Physique) checks made to climb or swim.

### Nightvision Goggles

While wearing these dark lenses, you have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, wearing the goggles increases its range by 60 feet.

### Collar of Disguise

_Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)_

While wearing this collar, you can use an action to cast the _disguise self_ tek skill from it at will. The collar distorts the light around your face to make it appear different. Your facial movements are mimicked by the illusion. The tek skill ends if the collar is removed.

### Nodule of Intellect

_Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)_

This electronic nodule sticks to the side of your head, giving you access to information in its memory bank. Your Intelligence score is 19 while you wear it. It has no effect on you if your Intelligence is already 19 or higher.

### Earpiece of Comprehending Languages

_Wondrous item, uncommon_

While wearing this earpiece, you can use an action to activate the _comprehend languages_ tek skill from it at will.

### Luck Blade

_Weapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunement)_

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this tek weapon. While the sword is on your person, you also gain a +1 bonus to saving throws.

**_Luck_**. If the sword is on your person, you can call on its luck (no action required) to reroll one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw you dislike. You must use the second roll. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.

**_Wish_**. The sword has 1d4 – 1 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and cast the _wish_ tek skill from it. This property can't be used again until the next dawn. The sword loses this property if it has no charges.

### Jumpsuit of Tek Resistance

_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)_

You have advantage on saving throws against tek skills while you wear this jumpsuit.

### Mithral Armor

_Armor (medium or heavy), uncommon_

Mithral is a light, flexible metal. Mithral flak armor can be worn under normal clothes. If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement, the mithral version of the armor doesn't.

### Oil of Sharpness

_Potion, very rare_

This clear, gelatinous oil sparkles with tiny, ultra-thin silver shards. The oil can coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition. Applying the oil takes 1 minute. For 1 hour, the coated item is tek and has a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls.

### Oil of Slipperiness

_Potion, uncommon_

This sticky black unguent is thick and heavy in the container, but it flows quickly when poured. The oil can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment it's wearing and carrying (one additional vial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of a _freedom of movement_ tek skill for 8 hours.

Alternatively, the oil can be poured on the ground as an action, where it covers a 10-foot square, duplicating the effect of the _grease_ tek skill in that area for 8 hours.

### Pearl of Power

_Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a tekcaster)_

While this pearl is on your person, you can use an action to insert it into your tekcaster and regain one expended tek skill slot. If the expended slot was of 4th level or higher, the new slot is 3rd level. Once you use the pearl, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

### Periapt of Wound Closure

_Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)_

While you wear this pendant, you stabilize whenever you are dying at the start of your turn. In addition, whenever you roll a Hit Die to regain hit points, double the number of hit points it restores.

### Portable Hole

_Wondrous item, rare_

This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.

You can use an action to unfold a _portable hole_ and place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the _portable hole_ creates an extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane, so it can't be used to create open passages. Any creature inside an open _portable hole_ can exit the hole by climbing out of it.

You can use an action to close a _portable hole_ by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what's in it, the hole weighs next to nothing.

If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole's extradimensional space can use an action to make a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the _portable hole_ or the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within a closed _portable hole_ can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.

Placing a _portable hole_ inside an extradimensional space created by a _bag of holding_, _handy haversack_, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.

### Potion of Climbing

_Potion, common_

When you drink this potion, your hands and feet grow spider-like grips. You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed for 1 hour. During this time, you have advantage on Strength (Physique) checks you make to climb. The potion is separated into brown, silver, and gray layers resembling bands of stone. Shaking the bottle fails to mix the colors.

### Vial of Giant Strength

_Potion, rarity varies_

When you inject this drug, your Strength score changes for 1 hour. The type of giant determines the score (see the table below). The drug has no effect on you if your Strength is equal to or greater than that score.

This potion's transparent liquid has floating in it a sliver of fingernail from a giant of the appropriate type. The _potion of frost giant strength_ and the _potion of stone giant strength_ have the same effect.

| Type of Giant     | Strength | Rarity    |
|-------------------|----------|-----------|
| Hill giant        | 21       | Uncommon  |
| Frost/stone giant | 23       | Rare      |
| Fire giant        | 25       | Rare      |
| Cloud giant       | 27       | Very rare |
| Storm giant       | 29       | Legendary |

### Potion of Healing

_Potion, rarity varies_

You regain hit points when you drink this potion. The number of hit points depends on the potion's rarity, as shown in the Potions of Healing table. Whatever its potency, the potion's red liquid glimmers when agitated.

**Potions of Healing (table)**

| Potion of ...    | Rarity    | HP Regained |
|------------------|-----------|-------------|
| Healing          | Common    | 2d4 + 2     |
| Greater healing  | Uncommon  | 4d4 + 4     |
| Superior healing | Rare      | 8d4 + 8     |
| Supreme healing  | Very rare | 10d4 + 20   |

### Potion of Heroism

_Potion, rare_

For 1 hour after drinking it, you gain 10 temporary hit points that last for 1 hour. For the same duration, you are under the effect of the _bless_ tek skill (no concentration required). This blue potion bubbles and steams as if boiling.

### Potion of Poison

_Potion, uncommon_

This concoction looks, smells, and tastes like a _potion of healing_ or other beneficial potion. However, it is actually poison masked by illusion tek. An _identify_ tek skill reveals its true nature.

If you drink it, you take 3d6 poison damage, and you must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned. At the start of each of your turns while you are poisoned in this way, you take 3d6 poison damage. At the end of each of your turns, you can repeat the saving throw. On a successful save, the poison damage you take on your subsequent turns decreases by 1d6. The poison ends when the damage decreases to 0.

### Potion of Resistance

_Potion, uncommon_

When you drink this potion, you gain resistance to one type of damage for 1 hour. The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly from the options below.

| d10 | Damage Type |
|-----|-------------|
| 1   | Acid        |
| 2   | Cold        |
| 3   | Fire        |
| 4   | Force       |
| 5   | Shock   |
| 6   | Radiation    |
| 7   | Poison      |
| 8   | Psychic     |
| 9   | Radiant     |
| 10  | Concussive     |

### Potion of Speed

_Potion, very rare_

When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the _haste_ tek skill for 1 minute (no concentration required). The potion's yellow fluid is streaked with black and swirls on its own.

### Restorative Ointment

_Wondrous item, uncommon_

This glass jar, 3 inches in diameter, contains 1d4 + 1 doses of a thick mixture that smells faintly of aloe. The jar and its contents weigh 1/2 pound.

As an action, one dose of the ointment can be swallowed or applied to the skin. The creature that receives it regains 2d8 + 2 hit points, ceases to be poisoned, and is cured of any disease.

### Ring of Telekinesis

_Ring, very rare (requires attunement)_

While wearing this ring, you can cast the _telekinesis_ tek skill at will, but you can target only objects that aren't being worn or carried.

### Rope of Climbing

_Wondrous item, uncommon_

This 60-foot length of silk rope weighs 3 pounds and can hold up to 3,000 pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak the command word, the rope animates. As a bonus action, you can command the other end to move toward a destination you choose. That end moves 10 feet on your turn when you first command it and 10 feet on each of your turns until reaching its destination, up to its maximum length away, or until you tell it to stop. You can also tell the rope to fasten itself securely to an object or to unfasten itself, to knot or unknot itself, or to coil itself for carrying.

If you tell the rope to knot, large knots appear at 1* foot intervals along the rope. While knotted, the rope shortens to a 50-foot length and grants advantage on checks made to climb it.

The rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.

### Rope of Entanglement

_Wondrous item, rare_

This rope is 30 feet long and weighs 3 pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak its command word, the other end darts forward to entangle a creature you can see within 20 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or become restrained.

You can release the creature by using a bonus action to speak a second command word. A target restrained by the rope can use an action to make a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity check (target's choice). On a success, the creature is no longer restrained by the rope.

The rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.

### Pulse Shield, +1, +2, or +3

_Armor (shield), uncommon (+1), rare (+2), or very rare (+3)_

While holding this shield, you have a bonus to AC determined by the shield's rarity. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC.

### Shield of Missile Attraction

_Armor (shield), rare (requires attunement)_

While holding this shield, you have resistance to damage from ranged weapon attacks.

**_Hack_**. This shield is hacked. Attuning to it hacks you until you are targeted by the _remove hack_ tek skill or similar tek. Removing the shield fails to end the hack on you. Whenever a ranged weapon attack is made against a target within 10 feet of you, the hack causes you to become the target instead.

### Sovereign Glue

_Wondrous item, legendary_

This viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond between any two objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated inside with _oil of slipperiness._ When found, a container contains 1d6 + 1 ounces.

One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square surface. The glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of _universal solvent_ or _oil of etherealness_, or with a _wish_ tek skill.

### Tekguard Shield

_Armor (shield), very rare (requires attunement)_

While holding this shield, you have advantage on saving throws against tek skills and other tek effects, and tek skill attacks have disadvantage against you.

### Sword of Sharpness

_Weapon (any sword that deals slashing damage), very rare (requires attunement)_

When you attack an object with this tek sword and hit, maximize your weapon damage dice against the target.

When you attack a creature with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, that target takes an extra 4d6 slashing damage. Then roll another d20. If you roll a 20, you lop off one of the target's limbs, with the effect of such loss determined by the GM. If the creature has no limb to sever, you lop off a portion of its body instead.

In addition, you can speak the sword's command word to cause the blade to shed bright light in a 10* foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. Speaking the command word again or sheathing the sword puts out the light.

### Sword of Wounding

_Weapon (any sword), rare (requires attunement)_

Hit points lost to this weapon's damage can be regained only through a short or long rest, rather than by regeneration, tek, or any other means.

Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack using this tek weapon, you can wound the target. At the start of each of the wounded creature's turns, it takes 1d4 radiation damage for each time you've wounded it, and it can then make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, ending the effect of all such wounds on itself on a success. Alternatively, the wounded creature, or a creature within 5 feet of it, can use an action to make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check, ending the effect of such wounds on it on a success.

### Universal Solvent

_Wondrous item, legendary_

This tube holds milky liquid with a strong alcohol smell. You can use an action to pour the contents of the tube onto a surface within reach. The liquid instantly dissolves up to 1 square foot of adhesive it touches, including _sovereign glue._

### Vicious Weapon

_Weapon (any), rare_

When you roll a 20 on your attack roll with this tek weapon, your critical hit deals an extra 2d6 damage of the weapon's type.

### Vorpal Sword

_Weapon (any sword that deals slashing damage), legendary (requires attunement)_

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this tek weapon. In addition, the weapon ignores resistance to slashing damage.

When you attack a creature that has at least one head with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature's heads. The creature dies if it can't survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, doesn't have or need a head, has legendary actions, or the GM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 6d8 slashing damage from the hit.

### Weapon, +1, +2, or +3

_Weapon (any), uncommon (+1), rare (+2), or very rare (+3)_

You have a bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this tek weapon. The bonus is determined by the weapon's rarity.

### Wind Fan

_Wondrous item, uncommon_

While holding this fan, you can use an action to cast the _gust of wind_ tek skill (save DC 13) from it. Once used, the fan shouldn't be used again until the next dawn. Each time it is used again before then, it has a cumulative 20 percent chance of not working and tearing into useless, nontek tatters.

### Grav Boots

_Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)_

While you wear these boots, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can use the boots to fly for up to 4 hours, all at once or in several shorter flights, each one using a minimum of 1 minute from the duration. If you are flying when the duration expires, you descend at a rate of 30 feet per round until you land.

The boots regain 2 hours of flying capability for every 12 hours they aren't in use.

### Jet Pack

_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)_

The jetpack gives you a flying speed of 60 feet for 1 hour. You can't use them again for 1d12 hours.

## Sentient Alien Artifacts

Some alien artifacts possess sentience and personality; self-aware thanks to the tek used to create it. The item behaves like a character, complete with personality quirks, ideals, bonds, and sometimes flaws. A sentient item might be a cherished ally to its wielder or a continual thorn in the side.

Most sentient items are weapons. Other kinds of items can manifest sentience, but consumable items such as potions and datacubes are never sentient.

Sentient alien artifacts function as NPCs under the GM's control. Any activated property of the item is under the item's control, not its wielder's. As long as the wielder maintains a good relationship with the item, the wielder can access those properties normally. If the relationship is strained, the item can suppress its activated properties or even turn them against the wielder.

### Creating Sentient Alien Artifacts

When you decide to make a alien artifact sentient, you create the item's persona in the same way you would create an NPC, with a few exceptions described here.

### Abilities

A sentient alien artifact has Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You can choose the item's abilities or determine them randomly. To determine them randomly, roll 4d6 for each one, dropping the lowest roll and totaling the rest.

### Communication

A sentient item has some ability to communicate, either by sharing its emotions, broadcasting its thoughts telepathically, or speaking aloud. You can choose how it communicates or roll on the following table.

| d100   | Communication                                                                                                                                                      |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 01–60  | The item communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it.                                                                             |
| 61–90  | The item can speak, read, and understand one or more languages.                                                                                                    |
| 91–100 | The item can speak, read, and understand one or more languages. In addition, the item can communicate telepathically with any character that carries or wields it. |

### Senses

With sentience comes awareness. A sentient item can perceive its surroundings out to a limited range. You can choose its senses or roll on the following table.

| d4 | Senses                                     |
|----|--------------------------------------------|
| 1  | Hearing and normal vision out to 30 feet.  |
| 2  | Hearing and normal vision out to 60 feet   |
| 3  | Hearing and normal vision out to 120 feet. |
| 4  | Hearing and darkvision out to 120 feet.    |

### Alignment

A sentient alien artifact has an alignment. Its creator or nature might suggest an alignment. If not, you can pick an alignment or roll on the following table.

| d100   | Alignment       |
|--------|-----------------|
| 01–15  | Lawful good     |
| 16–35  | Neutral good    |
| 36–50  | Chaotic good    |
| 51–63  | Lawful neutral  |
| 64–73  | Neutral         |
| 74–85  | Chaotic neutral |
| 86–89  | Lawful evil     |
| 90–96  | Neutral evil    |
| 97–100 | Chaotic evil    |

### Special Purpose

You can give a sentient item an objective it pursues, perhaps to the exclusion of all else. As long as the wielder's use of the item aligns with that special purpose, the item remains cooperative. Deviating from this course might cause conflict between the wielder and the item, and could even cause the item to prevent the use of its activated properties. You can pick a special purpose or roll on the following table.

| d10 | Purpose                                                                                                                                  |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | _Aligned:_ The item seeks to defeat or destroy those of a diametrically opposed alignment. (Such an item is never neutral.)              |
| 2   | _Bane:_ The item seeks to defeat or destroy creatures of a particular kind, such as fiends, shapechangers, trolls, or Arcanists.           |
| 3   | _Protector:_ The item seeks to defend a particular race or kind of creature, such as elves or morphs.                                    |
| 4   | _Crusader:_ The item seeks to defeat, weaken, or destroy the servants of a particular sect.                                             |
| 5   | _Templar_: The item seeks to defend the servants and interests of a particular sect.                                                    |
| 6   | _Destroyer:_ The item craves destruction and goads its user to fight arbitrarily.                                                        |
| 7   | _Glory Seeker:_ The item seeks renown as the greatest alien artifact in the world, by establishing its user as a famous or notorious figure. |
| 8   | _Lore Seeker:_ The item craves knowledge or is determined to solve a mystery, learn a secret, or unravel a cryptic prophecy.             |
| 9   | _Destiny Seeker:_ The item is convinced that it and its wielder have key roles to play in future events.                                 |
| 10  | _Creator Seeker:_ The item seeks its creator and wants to understand why it was created.                                                 |

### Conflict

A sentient item has a will of its own, shaped by its personality and alignment. If its wielder acts in a manner opposed to the item's alignment or purpose, conflict can arise. When such a conflict occurs, the item makes a Charisma check contested by the wielder's Charisma check. If the item wins the contest, it makes one or more of the following demands:

* The item insists on being carried or worn at all times.
* The item demands that its wielder dispose of anything the item finds repugnant.
* The item demands that its wielder pursue the item's goals to the exclusion of all other goals.
* The item demands to be given to someone else. If its wielder refuses to comply with the item's wishes, the item can do any or all of the following:

* Make it impossible for its wielder to attune to it.
* Suppress one or more of its activated properties.
* Attempt to take control of its wielder.

If a sentient item attempts to take control of its wielder, the wielder must make a Charisma saving throw, with a DC equal to 12 + the item's Charisma modifier. On a failed save, the wielder is charmed by the item for 1d12 hours. While charmed, the wielder must try to follow the item's commands. If the wielder takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. Whether the attempt to control its user succeeds or fails, the item can't use this power again until the next dawn.
