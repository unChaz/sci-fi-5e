# The Cryo-Emergent Handbook

## Introduction

Welcome to your new life! The Sol Commerce Authority (SCA) is responsible for reorienting all preserved Natural Humans into this new world.

Centuries ago it was common practice for terminally ill humans, or those with vast resources to facilitate the cryogenic preservation of their bodies to be revived when scientific advancement allowed.

SCA legislation HL-3404-C53 dictates that all cryogenically preserved pre-stack natural humans that have not been revived to be confiscated by the SCA. Your consciousness has been legally conscripted into indentured servitude to the SCA until you have paid off your contract.

You were not revived for one of the following reasons:

- Your sleeve was damaged and unsuitable to be revived.
- Your cryo insurance coverage was not comprehensive enough to cover the cost of sleeve repair.
- Your cryo insurance agency was waiting for your sleeve repair costs to become lower.
- The contract on your revival designated a date after HL-3404-C53 went into effect.

### Designation
At the time of emergence, all Cryo-Emergents, are given an eight digit alphanumeric designation beginning with ‘CE-’.

## Persona

SCA assesses each emergent for personality traits. Scores are given to each trait at a 1:1 ratio. Scores range between -2 and 4.

Personality traits were the results of a two decades long psychological study at the Ganymede Institute. These traits were determined to be the most core quantification of the natural human personality. These traits are completely independent of physical form, and represent the human mind.

| Trait | Description|
|:----:|:-------------|
| Wit  | Mental sharpness and inventiveness; keen intelligence. |
| Will  | Mental fortitude. This is the mind’s ability to resist magical effectrs, and mental stress. |
| Intelligence | The ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills. |
| Wisdom | The soundness of an action or decision with regard to the application of experience, knowledge, and good judgment. |

> ##### Artificial Intelligence
> The concept of Artificial Intelligence as it applies today is likely very different during your first life. AI as you know it does not exist. Any AI programs are under strict regulations to do only simple tasks.

## Sleeve

Thanks to modern cloning techniques, and the availability of confiscated human bodies, death no longer needs to be permanent.

Upon death, if your stack is recovered, you can purchase a new sleeve, or be provided one in the case of wrongful death, or if you are properly insured.

### Quality Control
All sleeves must be appraised by the **Board of Quality Control** to ensure buyer protection. Sleeves are appraised with the following traits:


| Trait | Description |
|:----:|:-------------|
|Strength |Physical strength |
|Dexterity | Agility, reflex, and balance |
|Charisma | Beauty, appearance |
|Constitution | Overall health |


## Skills
Average skill levels can be derived from these core Sleeve Traits, and Persona Traits to give you a better idea of the effectiveness of a sleeve. Each skill is a combination of 2 traits.

##### Skill Definition
| Skill | Trait Combinations |
|:----:|:-------------|
|Physique | Strength + Constitution |
|Acrobatics | Strength + Dexterity |
|Toughness | Constitution + Will |
|Intimidation | Strength + Wit |
|Medic | Will + Wisdom|
|Charm | Wit + Charisma|
|Stealth | Dexterity + Will|
|Perception | Wisdom + Wit|
|Computers | Wit + Intelligence|
|Performance | Dexterity + Charisma|
|Tinker | Dexterity + Intelligence|
|Pilot | Dexterity + Intelligence|
|Knowledge | Wisdom + Intelligence |
|Trickery | Dexterity + Wit|
|Investigation | Will + Intelligence|
|Insight | Charisma + Wisdom |
|Diplomacy | Intelligence + Charisma |
|Nature | Wisdom + Will |

### Skill Difficulty
In order to be successful at the given task, you roll the die, and add your skill score to the number you rolled. If the number is equal or higher than the difficulty score of the task, you were successful.

| Difficulty | Minimum Rolls |
|:----:|:-------------|
|Very Easy|10|
|Easy|15|
|Medium|20|
|Hard|25|
|Very Hard|30|
|Nearly Impossible|35|

The person determining the difficulty might increment the number on the table based on environmental conditions that might make the task easier or more difficult.

## “Magic”
 Major advancements in technology have enabled the use of “supernatural” “powers” in humans. Rare humans have the ability to cast what could be perceived as “magic spells” are in reality a marvel of modern technology.

### Focus
A focus is a small device that through a series of voice, movements, and occasionally a fuel source can cast “spells”.

- Wand - A small handheld device.
-Staff - A larger 2 handed device, equally effective as a wand, however can be used as a blunted weapon (1d4 bludgeoning), or a walking stick.
- Amulet - A device that optically reads hand movements. Leaves the hands free to do other things.

> ##### The two sources of Magic
> #### Knowledge
> One method to cast “spells” is to learn how to use them. This often involves lots of studying and  memorization. Using this method, the sleeve you are in does not impact how effective you are at casting “spells”.
>
> Classes that use this type of “magic” are Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Warlock, and Wizard.
>
> #### Genetic Alteration
> Another way to cast spells is to be genetically modified to do so. This prevents you from having to memorize “spells”, but you must be equipped with an adequate sleeve that has been genetically modified.
>
> Usually sleeves with above average Charisma or Constitution are better suited to this type of casting.
>
> Classes that use this type of “magic” are Bards, Paladins, and Sorcerers.


```
```

### Willpower
Regardless of the method of magic casting, Willpower is always at the core of casting spells. When estimating a caster’s “magical” ability, you add the relevant ability score to your Will score to determine your Techcasting power. The only exception is Bard, which uses their Wit and Charisma score since their magic is a form of performance.

Sleeve Market
All tier 1 quality sleeves are given basic genetic alterations. You merely need to specify which basic genetic alteration you desire, and a limited set of sleeves is presented for you to choose from.

Basic Genetic Alterations
(Free Upgrades)

Innate Techcasting

Genetic Enhancements
(Premium Upgrades)

Enhanced Muscle Memory: +1 PHY
Thick Skinned: +1 CON
Integrated Synapses: +1 DEX
Curated Aesthetics: +1 CHA

Basic sleeve insurance does not cover genetic enhancements. You can upgrade for a cost to a maximum of +2 per trait.

|  Upgrades | Cost |
|:----:|:-------------|
|1| 50,000c|
|2| 90,000c|
|3| 130,000c|
|4| 160,000c|

Upgrades can be retained when transferring to a new sleeve, or a return of 80% of the upgrade cost will be returned to you.

## Feats
At every 4 stack levels the Board of Quality Control awards employees with a free stack or sleeve upgrade. These upgrades come in a form of a predefined “feat” or a genetic alteration or stack data upload.
A list of available feats can be provided upon request.

Alternatively, you can be awarded 2 points to be allocated towards a genetic sleeve upgrade, or a data upload to your stack.

### Genetic Upgrade Option
Based on the type of genetic alteration (Physique, Constitution, Dexterity, Charisma), you will either be issued a new similar sleeve, or given genetic enhancements to your current sleeve. You may be given the option to choose.

### Data Upload Option
One unit of data uploaded to your stack will be guaranteed to be enough to increase your Wit, Will, Intelligence or Wisdom assessment score by 1 point.

## Sleeve Races

---

#### Racial Traits

The description of each race includes racial traits that are common to members of that race. The following entries appear among the traits of most races.

##### Ability Score Increase

Every race increases one or more of a character’s ability scores.

##### Age

The age entry notes the age when a member of the race is considered an adult, as well as the race’s expected lifespan. This information can help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game. You can choose any age for your character, which could provide an explanation for some of your ability scores. For example, if you play a young or very old character, your age could explain a particularly low Strength or Constitution score, while advanced age could account for a high Intelligence or Wisdom.

##### Alignment

Most races have tendencies toward certain alignments, described in this entry. These are not binding for player characters, but considering why your dwarf is chaotic, for example, in defiance of lawful dwarf society can help you better define your character.

##### Size

Characters of most races are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few races are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding heavy weapons, as explained in “Equipment.”

##### Speed

Your speed determines how far you can move when traveling (“Adventuring”) and fighting (“Combat”).

##### Languages

By virtue of your race, your character can speak, read, and write certain languages.

##### Subraces

Some races have subraces. Members of a subrace have the traits of the parent race in addition to the traits specified for their subrace. Relationships among subraces vary significantly from race to race and world to world.


```
```


### Human

#### Human Traits

It’s hard to make generalizations about humans, but your human character has these traits.

**_Ability Score Increase._** Two ability scores each increase by 1.

**_Age._** Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

**_Alignment._** Humans tend toward no particular alignment. The best and the worst are found among them.

**_Size._** Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

**_Speed._** Your base walking speed is 30 feet. **_Languages._** You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice.

Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects.

## Backgrounds

Every story has a beginning. Your character’s background reveals where you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the world. Your fighter might have been a courageous knight or a grizzled soldier. Your wizard could have been a sage or an artisan. Your rogue might have gotten by as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a jester.

Choosing a background provides you with important story cues about your character’s identity. The most important question to ask about your background is *what changed*? Why did you stop doing whatever your background describes and start adventuring? Where did you get the money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why don’t you have *more* money? How did you learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share your background?

The sample backgrounds in this chapter provide both concrete benefits (features, proficiencies, and languages) and roleplaying suggestions.

##### Proficiencies

Each background gives a character proficiency in two skills (described in “Using Ability Scores”).

In addition, most backgrounds give a character proficiency with one or more tools (detailed in “Equipment”).

If a character would gain the same proficiency from two different sources, he or she can choose a different proficiency of the same kind (skill or tool) instead.

##### Languages

Some backgrounds also allow characters to learn additional languages beyond those given by race. See “Languages.”

##### Equipment

Each background provides a package of starting equipment. If you use the optional rule to spend coin on gear, you do not receive the starting equipment from your background.

##### Suggested Characteristics

A background contains suggested personal characteristics based on your background. You can pick characteristics, roll dice to determine them randomly, or use the suggestions as inspiration for characteristics of your own creation.

##### Customizing a Background

You might want to tweak some of the features of a background so it better fits your character or the campaign setting. To customize a background, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose any two skills, and choose a total of two tool proficiencies or languages from the sample backgrounds. You can either use the equipment package from your background or spend coin on gear as described in the equipment section. (If you spend coin, you can’t also take the equipment package suggested for your class.) Finally, choose two personality traits, one ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you can’t find a feature that matches your desired background, work with your GM to create one.
