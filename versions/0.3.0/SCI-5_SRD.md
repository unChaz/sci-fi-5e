# The Cryo-Emergent Handbook

## Introduction

Welcome to your new life! The Sol Commerce Authority (SCA) is responsible for reorienting all preserved Natural Humans into this new world.

Centuries ago it was common practice for terminally ill humans, or those with vast resources to facilitate the cryogenic preservation of their bodies to be revived when scientific advancement allowed.

SCA legislation HL-3404-C53 dictates that all cryogenically preserved pre-stack natural humans that have not been revived to be confiscated by the SCA. Your consciousness has been legally conscripted into indentured servitude to the SCA until you have paid off your contract.

You were not revived for one of the following reasons:

- Your sleeve was damaged and unsuitable to be revived.
- Your cryo insurance coverage was not comprehensive enough to cover the cost of sleeve repair.
- Your cryo insurance agency was waiting for your sleeve repair costs to become lower.
- The contract on your revival designated a date after HL-3404-C53 went into effect.

## Persona
SCA assesses each emergent for personality traits. Scores range between -2 and 2.

Personality traits were the results of a two decades long psychological study at the Ganymede Institute. These traits were determined to be the most core quantification of the natural human personality. These traits are completely independent of physical form, and represent the human mind.

| Trait | Description|
|:----:|:-------------|
| Wit  | Mental sharpness and inventiveness; keen intelligence. |
| Will  | Mental fortitude. This is the mind’s ability to resist tek effectrs, and mental stress. |
| Intelligence | The ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills. |
| Wisdom | The soundness of an action or decision with regard to the application of experience, knowledge, and good judgment. |

> ### Calculating Ability Scores
> Each ability score is calculated by rolling 3d4, dropping the lowest, and subtracting 4 from the result.

```
```

### Stack

Thanks to modern cloning techniques, and the availability of confiscated human bodies, death no longer needs to be permanent.

Each human is given a Stack that is installed at the base of the neck connected to your spinal cord. The Stack contains a complete record of your conscious mind. In the event of your death you can be given a new body. Additionally traveling across the solar system has never been faster with the ability to stream your stack backup to a new body. If you have the funds, you can even have a cloned body ready for you on the other side.

If your stack is destroyed however, there is no bringing you back. That is called "true death". The punishment for murder has been lessened with the exception of those who have religious encoding specifying they do not wish to be spun back up.

Having two copies or more of the same stack is illegal, and punishable by the true death of all copies.

It is also possible to enter into a totally virtual environment via the stack. Using this method we can spin up a virtual instance of a person in VR to question them about thier death, or keep prisoners sedated inside a virtual environment which we control.

## Sleeve

Thanks to modern cloning techniques, and the availability of confiscated human bodies, death no longer needs to be permanent.

Upon death, if your stack is recovered, you can purchase a new sleeve, or be provided one in the case of wrongful death, or if you are properly insured.

### Quality Control
All sleeves must be appraised by the **Board of Quality Control** to ensure buyer protection. Sleeves are appraised with the following traits with a score between -2 and 2:


| Trait | Description |
|:----:|:-------------|
|Strength |Physical strength |
|Dexterity | Agility, reflex, and balance |
|Charisma | Beauty, appearance |
|Constitution | Overall health |


## Skills
Average skill levels can be derived from these core Sleeve Traits, and Persona Traits to give you a better idea of the effectiveness of a sleeve. Each skill is a combination of 2 traits.

##### Skill Definition
| Skill | Trait Combinations |
|:----:|:-------------|
|Physique | Strength + Constitution |
|Acrobatics | Strength + Dexterity |
|Toughness | Constitution + Will |
|Intimidation | Strength + Wit |
|Medic | Will + Wisdom|
|Charm | Wit + Charisma|
|Stealth | Dexterity + Will|
|Perception | Wisdom + Wit|
|Computers | Wit + Intelligence|
|Performance | Dexterity + Charisma|
|Tinker | Dexterity + Intelligence|
|Piloting | Dexterity + Intelligence|
|History | Wisdom + Intelligence |
|Arcana | Wisdom + Intelligence |
|Trickery | Dexterity + Wit|
|Investigation | Will + Intelligence|
|Insight | Charisma + Wisdom |
|Diplomacy | Intelligence + Charisma |
|Nature | Wisdom + Will |

\page

### Skill Difficulty
In order to be successful at the given task, you roll the die, and add your skill score to the number you rolled. If the number is equal or higher than the difficulty score of the task, you were successful.

| Difficulty | Minimum Rolls |
|:----:|:-------------|
|Very Easy|10|
|Easy|15|
|Medium|20|
|Hard|25|
|Very Hard|30|
|Nearly Impossible|35|

The person determining the difficulty might increment the number on the table based on environmental conditions that might make the task easier or more difficult.

## Tekcasting
 Major advancements in technology have enabled the use of seemingly supernatural powers. Some humans have the ability to use tekcasters, devices discovered from a derelict alien spacestation.

### Focus
The focus used by those casting tek skills is called a Tekcaster. The tekcaster is a device worn on the wrist and is connected to the fingers. Using a combination of hand movements, vocal commands, and material components, the tekcaster can be used to cast tek skills. One can wield a weapon while wearing a tekcaster, but the hand must be free to use it.

> ##### The two sources of Tek Skill
> #### History
> One method to cast tek skills is to learn how to use them. This often involves lots of studying and  memorization. Using this method, the sleeve you are in does not impact how effective you are at casting tek skills.
>
> Classes that use this type of tek are Priest , Morph, Scout, Cybernetic, and Arcanist.
>
> #### Genetic Alteration
> Another way to cast tek skills is to be genetically modified to do so. This prevents you from having to memorize tek skills, but you must be equipped with an adequate sleeve that has been genetically modified.
>
> Usually sleeves with above average Charisma or Constitution are better suited to this type of casting.
>
> Classes that use this type of tek are Evangelists, Guardians, and Scions.


```
```

### Willpower
Regardless of the method of tek casting, Willpower is always at the core of casting tek skills. When estimating a caster’s tek ability, you add the relevant ability score to your Will score to determine your Tekcasting power. The only exception is Evangelist, which uses their Wit and Charisma score since their tek is a form of performance.

Sleeve Market
All tier 1 quality sleeves are given basic genetic alterations. You merely need to specify which basic genetic alteration you desire, and a limited set of sleeves is presented for you to choose from.

Basic Genetic Alterations
(Free Upgrades)

Innate Tekcasting

Genetic Enhancements
(Premium Upgrades)

Enhanced Muscle Memory: +1 PHY
Thick Skinned: +1 CON
Integrated Synapses: +1 DEX
Curated Aesthetics: +1 CHA

Basic sleeve insurance does not cover genetic enhancements. You can upgrade for a cost to a maximum of +2 per trait.

|  Upgrades | Cost |
|:----:|:-------------|
|1| 50,000c|
|2| 90,000c|
|3| 130,000c|
|4| 160,000c|

Upgrades can be retained when transferring to a new sleeve, or a return of 80% of the upgrade cost will be returned to you.

## Feats
At every 4 stack levels the Board of Quality Control awards employees with a free stack or sleeve upgrade. These upgrades come in a form of a predefined “feat” or a genetic alteration or stack data upload.
A list of available feats can be provided upon request.

Alternatively, you can be awarded 2 points to be allocated towards a genetic sleeve upgrade, or a data upload to your stack.

### Genetic Upgrade Option
Based on the type of genetic alteration (Physique, Constitution, Dexterity, Charisma), you will either be issued a new similar sleeve, or given genetic enhancements to your current sleeve. You may be given the option to choose.

### Data Upload Option
One unit of data uploaded to your stack will be guaranteed to be enough to increase your Wit, Will, Intelligence or Wisdom assessment score by 1 point.

## Classes

# Arcanist

The Arcanist is a scholar who has studied the nuanced science of tekcasting, also known as the Arcane Arts.

As an arcanist, you gain the following class features

### Hit Points

**Hit Dice:** 1d6 per Arcanist level

**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 6 + your Constitution Modifier + Will modifier

**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution Modifier + Will modifier per Arcanist level after 1st

### Proficiencies

**Armor:** None

**Weapons:** ion daggers, darts, slings, bowstaffs, scorchers

**Tools:** None

**Saving Throws:** Intelligence, Wisdom

**Skills:** Choose two from Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine

### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
* *(a)* a Bowstaff or (*b*) an ion dagger
* *(a)* a component pouch or (*b*) an tekcaster
* *(a)* a scholar’s pack or (*b*) a field survival kit
* A datapad

### Tekcasting

As a student of arcane tek, you have a tek skill datapad containing tek skills that show the first glimmerings of your true power.

### Cantrips

At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the Arcanist tek skill list. You learn additional Arcanist cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Arcanist table.

```
```
### Tek Datapad

At 1st level, you have a tek skill datapad containing six 1st- level Arcanist tek skills of your choice. Your tek skill datapad is the repository of the Arcanist tek skills you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.


### Preparing and Casting Tek Skills

The Arcanist table shows how many tek skill slots you have to cast your tek skills of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these tek skills, you must expend a slot of the tek skill’s level or higher. You regain all expended tek skill slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of Arcanist tek skills that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of Arcanist tek skills from your tek skill datapad equal to your Intelligence modifier + your Arcanist level (minimum of one tek skill). The tek skills must be of a level for which you have tek skill slots.

You can change your list of prepared tek skills when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of Arcanist tek skills requires time spent studying your tek skill datapad and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the tek skill: at least 1 minute per tek skill level for each tek skill on your list.

### Tekcasting Ability

Intelligence + Will is your Tekcasting ability for your Arcanist tek skills, since you learn your tek skills through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a tek skill refers to your Tekcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an arcanist tek skill you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Tek save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier + your Will modifier

**Tek attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier + your Will modifier

### Ritual Casting

You can cast an arcanist tek skill as a ritual if that tek skill has the ritual tag and you have the tek skill in your tek skill datapad. You don’t need to have the tek skill prepared.

### Tekcasting Focus

You can use an tekcaster as a Tekcasting focus for your Arcanist tek skills.

#### Learning Tek Skills of 1st Level and Higher

Each time you gain an arcanist level, you can add two Arcanist tek skills of your choice to your tek skill datapad for free. Each of these tek skills must be of a level for which you have tek skill slots, as shown on the Arcanist table. On your adventures, you might find other tek skills that you can add to your tek skill datapad (see the “Your tek skill datapad” sidebar).

### Arcane Recovery

You have learned to regain some of your tek energy by studying your tek skill datapad. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended tek skill slots to recover. The tek skill slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your Arcanist level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.

For example, if you’re a 4th-level Arcanist, you can recover up to two levels worth of tek skill slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level tek skill slot or two 1st-level tek skill slots.

### Arcane Tradition

When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of tek through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation, all detailed at the end of the class description.

Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

```
```

### Tek Mastery

At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain tek skills that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level Arcanist tek skill and a 2nd-level Arcanist tek skill that are in your tek skill datapad. You can cast those tek skills at their lowest level without expending a tek skill slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either tek skill at a higher level, you must expend a tek skill slot as normal.

By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the tek skills you chose for different tek skills of the same levels.

### Signature Tek Skills

When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful tek skills and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level Arcanist tek skills in your tek skill datapad as your signature tek skills. You always have these tek skills prepared, they don’t count against the number of tek skills you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a tek skill slot. When you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

If you want to cast either tek skill at a higher level, you must expend a tek skill slot as normal.

## Arcane Traditions

The study of the arcane arts began with the discoveries of tek.

The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of tek. Arcanists through the centuries have cataloged thousands of tek skills, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools; an arcanist might study at the School of Illusion while another studies across town at the School of Enchantment. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even Arcanists who train apprentices in the solitude of their own apartments use the division of tek into schools as a learning device, since the tek skills of each school require mastery of different techniques.

## School of Evocation

You focus your study on tek that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling concussive, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as pirates, explorers, or aspiring tyrants.

### Evocation Savant

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the credits and time you must spend to copy an evocation tek skill into your tek skill datapad is halved.

### Sculpt Tek Skills

Beginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocation tek skills. When you cast an evocation tek skill that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the tek skill’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the tek skill, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.

### Potent Cantrip

Starting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip’s damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.

### Empowered Evocation

Beginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of any Arcanist evocation tek skill you cast.

```
```

### Overchannel

Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler tek skills. When you cast an arcanist tek skill of 1st through 5th level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that tek skill.

The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 radiation damage for each level of the tek skill, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the radiation damage per tek skill level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.

> ## Your tek skill datapad
>
> Arcanists use a datapad to compile all of the knowledge of the arcane arts.
>
> The tek skills that you add to your tek skill datapad as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other tek skills during your adventures. You could discover a tek skill recorded on a datacube in an evil Arcanist’s chest, for example, or in a dusty disk in an ancient library.
>
> **_Copying a Tek into the Datapad._** When you find an arcanist tek skill of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your tek skill datapad if it is of a tek skill level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.
>
> Copying that tek skill into your tek skill datapad involves reproducing the basic form of the tek skill, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the Arcanist who wrote it. You must practice the tek skill until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then type it into your tek skill datapad using your own notation. If the tek skill is in the form of digital data, it can simply be scanned into your datapad, but you must still spend time to learn how to use it.
>
> For each level of the tek skill, the process takes 2 hours and costs 5000 credits.

# Brute

## Class Features

As a brute, you gain the following class features.

### Hit Points

**Hit Dice:** 1d12 per brute level

**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 12 + your Constitution Modifier + Will modifier

**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d12 (or 7) + your Constitution Modifier + Will modifier per brute level after 1st

### Proficiencies

**Armor:** Light armor, medium armor, pulse shields

**Weapons:** Simple weapons, martial weapons

**Tools:** None

**Saving Throws:** Strength, Constitution

**Skills:** Choose two from  Physique, Intimidation, Perception, and Nature

### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

* (*a*) a pulse axe or (*b*) any martial melee weapon
* (*a*) a pulse fist or (*b*) any simple weapon
* a field survival kit and two ion daggers

```
```

## Rage

In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.

While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t wearing heavy armor:

* You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
* When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a brute, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Brute table.
* You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

If you are able to cast tek skills, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while raging.

Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.

Once you have raged the number of times shown for your brute level in the Rages column of the Brute table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.

### Unarmored Defense

While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution Modifier + Will modifier. You can use A medkit and still gain this benefit.

### Reckless Attack

Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.

### Danger Sense

At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.

You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and tek skills. To gain this benefit, you can’t be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.

### Primal Path

At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Choose the Path of the Berserker or the Path of the Totem Warrior, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.

</div>

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Fast Movement

Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing heavy armor.

### Heavily Armored

Starting at 5th level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor.

### Feral Instinct

By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.

Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren’t incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.

```
```
### Brutal Critical

Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.

This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.

### Relentless Rage

Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you’re raging and don’t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.

Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.

### Persistent Rage

Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it.

### Indomitable Might

Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.

\page

### Primal Champion

At 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.

## Brute Paths

### Path of the Berserker

For some brutes, rage is a means to an end— that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker’s rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.

#### Frenzy

Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion (as described in appendix A).

#### Mindless Rage

Beginning at 6th level, you can’t be charmed or frightened while raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage.

#### Intimidating Presence

Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.

If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can’t use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.

#### Retaliation

Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.

\page
# Cybernetic


## Class Features

As a cybernetic, you gain the following class features.

### Hit Points

**Hit Dice:** 1d8 per cybernetic level

**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution Modifier + Will modifier

**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution Modifier + Will modifier per cybernetic level after 1st

### Proficiencies

**Armor:** Light armor

**Weapons:** Simple weapons

**Tools:** None

**Saving Throws:** Wisdom, Charisma

**Skills:** Choose two skills from History, Charm, History, Intimidation, Investigation, and Nature

### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
* *(a)* a scorcher and 20 clips of ammunition or (*b*) any simple weapon
* *(a)* a scholar’s pack or (*b*) an incursion kit
* a tekcaster
* Flak armor, and two ion daggers

## Bionic Enhancements

At 1st level, to allow you to to seamlessly interface with computers, you have been upgraded with bionic enhancements. Your sleeve must be synthetic, bionic, or you have paid to have custom bionic enhancements installed.

## AI Patron

At 1st level, through your bionic enhancements, you have bonded with an ancient alien AI called a "Symbiote". Your Symbiote makes it easy for you to interface with nearby networks and computers, and usually comes with a quirky personality.

## Symbiote Tek

Your arcane research and the tek bestowed on you by your Symbiote have given you facility with tek skills.

### Cantrips

You know two cantrips of your choice from the cybernetic tek skill list. You learn additional cybernetic cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cybernetic table.

```
```

### Tek Slots

The Cybernetic table shows how many tek skill slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your tek skill slots are the same level. To cast one of your cybernetic tek skills of 1st level or higher, you must expend a tek skill slot. You regain all expended tek skill slots when you finish a short or long rest.

For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level tek skill slots. To cast the 1st-level tek skill *shockwave*, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level tek skill.

### Tek Skills Known of 1st Level and Higher

At 1st level, you know two 1st-level tek skills of your choice from the cybernetic tek skill list.

The Tek Skills Known column of the Cybernetic table shows when you learn more cybernetic tek skills of your choice of 1st level and higher. A tek skill you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new cybernetic tek skill, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the cybernetic tek skills you know and replace it with another tek skill from the cybernetic tek skill list, which also must be of a level for which you have tek skill slots.

</div>
### Tekcasting Ability

Charisma + Will is your Tekcasting ability for your cybernetic tek skills, so you use your Charisma whenever a tek skill refers to your Tekcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cybernetic tek skill you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Tek save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier + your Will modifier

**Tek attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier + your Will modifier + your Wit modifier

### Tekcasting Focus

You can use an tekcaster as a Tekcasting focus for your cybernetic tek skills.

## Nanotech Modules

Your Symbiote provides you with access to alien nanotech that imbue you with an abiding tek ability.

At 2nd level, you gain two nanotech modules of your choice. Your module options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain cybernetic levels, you gain additional modules of your choice, as shown in the Modules Known column of the Cybernetic table.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the modules you know and replace it with another module that you could learn at that level.

## Symbiotic Links

At 3rd level, your Symbiote gives you one of the following features of your choice.

### Link of the Drone

You learn the *find familiar* tek skill and can cast it as a ritual. The tek skill doesn’t count against your number of tek skills known.

When you cast the tek skill, the form of your familiar is a recon drone with a fly speed of 60, 13 AC, 7 HP, Perception +3, Stealth +4, 60ft of darkvision, 10ft of blindsight.

The familiar is controlled by your Symbiote, and you gain all normal benefits of a familiar.

Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its reaction.

### Link of the Blade

You can use your action to create a Nanoblade in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as tek for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nontek attacks and damage.

Your Nanoblade disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.

\page

You can transform one tek weapon into your Nanoblade by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your Nanoblade thereafter. You can’t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your Nanoblade if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.

### Link of the Tome

Your Symbiote gives you access to more tekskills. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class’s tek skill list (the three needn’t be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don’t count against your number of cantrips known. If they don’t appear on the cybernetic tek skill list, they are nonetheless cybernetic tek skills for you.

## Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

## Mystic Arcanum

At 11th level, your Symbiote bestows upon you a tek secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th- level tek skill from the cybernetic tek skill list as this arcanum.

You can cast your arcanum tek skill once without expending a tek skill slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

At higher levels, you gain more cybernetic tek skills of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th- level tek skill at 13th level, one 8th-level tek skill at 15th level, and one 9th-level tek skill at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.

## Symbiote Master

At 20th level, you can draw on your reserve of tak power while entreating your Symbiote to regain expended tek skill slots. You can spend 1 minute entreating your Symbiote for aid to regain all your expended tek skill slots from your Link Tek feature. Once you regain tek skill slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

```
```

\page

## AI Symbiotes

The beings that serve as Symbiotes for cybernetics are ancient alien AI that sat dormant for thousands of years. Once you form a link with your Symbiote, it makes a copy of itself inside your cybernetic circuitry.

### The Fiend

You have formed a bond with the remnants of an AI from before the great AI war, a being whose aims are evil, even if you strive against those aims. Such beings desire the corruption or destruction of all things, ultimately including you. These AI, while symbiotic to you, and cannot function outside of your body, are constantly tempting you to do evil things, and is obsessed with destruction.

## Expanded Tek List

The Fiend lets you choose from an expanded list of tek skills when you learn a cybernetic tek skill. The following tek skills are added to the cybernetic tek skill list for you.

**Fiend Expanded Tek Skills (table)**

| Tek Level | Tek Skills                            |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| 1st         | burning hands, command            |
| 2nd         | blindness/deafness, scorching ray |
| 3rd         | fireball, stinking cloud          |
| 4th         | fire shield, wall of fire         |
| 5th         | flame strike, hallow              |

## Dark One’s Blessing

Starting at 1st level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + your cybernetic level (minimum of 1).

## Dark One’s Own Luck

Starting at 6th level, you can call on your Symbiote to alter fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add a d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the initial roll but before any of the roll’s effects occur.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Fiendish Resilience

Starting at 10th level, you can choose one damage type when you finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature. Damage from tek weapons or silver weapons ignores this resistance.

## Hurl Through Hell

Starting at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can use this feature to instantly transport the target through the lower planes. The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape.

At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is not a fiend, it takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific experience.

### The Hexblade

You have made a bond with an ancient alien nanoblade. These Hexblades were created to destroy only evil, and were designed to transform themselves into harmless when a holder attempted to do evil with them. Over the ages their AI has evolved to discover its own ambitions, and attempts to use you to accomplish them.

## Expanded Tek List

The Fiend lets you choose from an expanded list of tek skills when you learn a cybernetic tek skill. The following tek skills are added to the cybernetic tek skill list for you.

**Fiend Expanded Tek Skills (table)**

| Tek Level | Tek Skills                            |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| 1st         | shield, wrathful smite          |
| 2nd         | blur, branding smite |
| 3rd         | blink, elemental weapon          |
| 4th         | phantasmal killer, staggering smite |
| 5th         | banishing smite, cone of cold |

## Blade Hex

Starting at 1st level, you gain the ability to place a baleful curse on someone. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target is cursed for 1 minute. The curse ends early if the target dies, you die, or you are incapacitated. Until the curse ends, you gain the following benefits:

- You gain a bonus to damage rolls against the cursed target. The bonus equals your proficiency bonus.
- Any attack roll you make against the cursed target is a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.
- If the cursed target dies, you regain hit points equal to your warlock level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 hit point).
- You can’t use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.

\page

## Hex Warrior

At 1st level, you acquire the training necessary to effectively arm yourself for battle. You gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and martial weapons.

The influence of your patron also allows you to mystically channel your will through a particular weapon. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one weapon that you are proficient with and that lacks the two-handed property. When you attack with that weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest. If you later gain the Pact of the Blade feature, this benefit extends to every pact weapon you conjure with that feature, no matter the weapon’s type.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Accursed Specter

Starting at 6th level, you can curse the soul of a person you slay, temporarily binding it to your service. When you slay a humanoid, you can cause its spirit to rise from its corpse as a specter, the statistics for which are in the Monster Manual. When the specter appears, it gains temporary hit points equal to half your warlock level. Roll initiative for the specter, which has its own turns. It obeys your verbal commands, and it gains a special bonus to its attack rolls equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +0).

The specter remains in your service until the end of your next long rest, at which point it vanishes to the afterlife.

Once you bind a specter with this feature, you can’t use the feature again until you finish a long rest.

## Armor of Hexes
At 10th level, your hex grows more powerful. If the target cursed by your Hexblade’s Curse hits you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to roll a d6. On a 4 or higher, the attack instead misses you, regardless of its roll.

## Master of Hexes
Starting at 14th level, you can spread your Hexblade’s Curse from a slain creature to another creature. When the creature cursed by your Hexblade’s Curse dies, you can apply the curse to a different creature you can see within 30 feet of you, provided you aren’t incapacitated. When you apply the curse in this way, you don’t regain hit points from the death of the previously cursed creature.

#### Tekcasting

You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in harmony with your wishes and music.

Your tek skills are part of your vast repertoire, tek that you can tune to different situations.

#### Cantrips

You know two cantrips of your choice from the evangelist tek skill list. You learn additional evangelist cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Evangelist table.

#### Tek Slots

The Evangelist table shows how many tek skill slots you have to cast your tek skills of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these tek skills, you must expend a slot of the tek skill’s level or higher. You regain all expended tek skill slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level tek skill *cure wounds* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level tek skill slot available, you can cast *cure wounds* using either slot.

```
```

##### Tek Skills Known of 1st Level and Higher

You know four 1st-level tek skills of your choice from the evangelist tek skill list.

The Tek Skills Known column of the Evangelist table shows when you learn more evangelist tek skills of your choice. Each of these tek skills must be of a level for which you have tek skill slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new tek skill of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the evangelist tek skills you know and replace it with another tek skill from the evangelist tek skill list, which also must be of a level for which you have tek skill slots.

#### Tekcasting Ability

Charisma + Wit is your Tekcasting ability for your evangelist tek skills. Your tek comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a tek skill refers to your Tekcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a evangelist tek skill you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Tek save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier + your Will modifier + your Wit modifier

**Tek attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier + your Wit modifier

##### Ritual Casting

You can cast any evangelist tek skill you know as a ritual if that tek skill has the ritual tag.

##### Tekcasting Focus

You can use a tek integrated musical instrument (see chapter 5, “Equip-ment”) as a Tekcasting focus for your evangelist tek skills.

#### Evangelistic Inspiration

You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Evangelistic Inspiration die, a d6.

Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Evangelistic Inspiration die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Evangelistic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Evangelistic Inspiration die at a time.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Your Evangelistic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.

</div>

### Jack of All Trades

Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn’t already include your proficiency bonus.

### Song of Rest

Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.

The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.

### Evangelist College

At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a evangelist college of your choice: the College of Lore or the College of Valor, both detailed at the end of

the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level.

```
```

### Expertise

At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.

At 10th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this benefit.

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Font of Inspiration

Beginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Evangelistic Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest.

\page

#### Countercharm

At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).

#### Tek Secrets

By 10th level, you have plundered tek knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines. Choose two tek skills from any class, including this one. A tek skill you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Evangelist table, or a cantrip.

The chosen tek skills count as evangelist tek skills for you and are included in the number in the Tek Skills Known column of the Evangelist table.

You learn two additional tek skills from any class at 14th level and again at 18th level.

### Superior Inspiration

At 20th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Evangelistic Inspiration left, you regain one use.

## Evangelist Colleges

### College of Lore

Evangelists of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these evangelists use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king.

The loyalty of these evangelists lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a sect. A noble who keeps such a evangelist as a herald or advisor knows that the evangelist would rather be honest than politic.

The college’s members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.

#### Bonus Proficiencies

When you join the College of Lore at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with three skills of your choice.

```
```

#### Cutting Words

Also at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of Evangelistic Inspiration, rolling a Evangelistic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature’s roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the GM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage. The creature is immune if it can’t hear you or if it’s immune to being charmed.

#### Additional Tek Secrets

At 6th level, you learn two tek skills of your choice from any class. A tek skill you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Evangelist table, or a cantrip. The chosen tek skills count as evangelist tek skills for you but don’t count against the number of evangelist tek skills you know.

#### Peerless Skill

Starting at 14th level, when you make an ability check, you can expend one use of Evangelistic Inspiration. Roll a Evangelistic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your ability check. You can choose to do so after you roll the die for the ability check, but before the GM tells you whether you succeed or fail.

# Guardian

Guardians are warriors who pledged an oath to an alien entity, usually lawful-good. In exchange for their oaths they have been given a tekcaster and the secrets of casting Guardian tekskills.

## Class Features

As a guardian, you gain the following class features.

### Hit Points

**Hit Dice:** 1d10 per guardian level

**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 10 + your Constitution Modifier + Will modifier

**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution Modifier + Will modifier per guardian level after 1st

### Proficiencies

**Armor:** All armor, pulse shields

**Weapons:** Simple weapons, martial weapons

**Tools:** None

**Saving Throws:** Wisdom, Charisma

**Skills:** Choose two from Physique, Insight, Intimidation, Medicine, Charm, and Religion

### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
* (*a*) a martial weapon and a medkit or (*b*) two martial weapons
* (*a*) a scorcher (*b*) any simple melee weapon
* (*a*) a chaplin's pack or (*b*) a field survival kit
* scarab skin and a holy symbol

## Alien Sense

The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any Alien, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (Alien, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire

Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the *hallow* tek skill.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.

```
```

## Lay on Hands

Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your guardian level × 5.

As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.

Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.

This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.

## Fighting Style

At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

### Defense

While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

### Dueling

When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

### Great Weapon Fighting

When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

### Protection

When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding A medkit.

\page

## Tekcasting

By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on Alien tek through meditation and prayer to cast tek skills as a priest does.

### Preparing and Casting Tek Skills

The Guardian table shows how many tek skill slots you have to cast your tek skills. To cast one of your guardian tek skills of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the tek skill’s level or higher. You regain all expended tek skill slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of guardian tek skills that are available for you to cast, choosing from the guardian tek skill list. When you do so, choose a number of guardian tek skills equal to your Charisma modifier + half your guardian level, rounded down (minimum of one tek skill). The tek skills must be of a level for which you have tek skill slots.

For example, if you are a 5th-level guardian, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level tek skill slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared tek skills can include four tek skills of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level tek skill *cure wounds,* you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd- level slot. Casting the tek skill doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared tek skills.

You can change your list of prepared tek skills when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of guardian tek skills requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per tek skill level for each tek skill on your list.

### Tekcasting Ability

Charisma + Will is your Tekcasting ability for your guardian tek skills, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a tek skill refers to your Tekcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a guardian tek skill you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Tek save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier + your Will modifier

**Tek attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier + your Will modifier + your Wit modifier

### Tekcasting Focus

You can use a holy symbol as a Tekcasting focus for your guardian tek skills.

## Alien Smite

Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one tek skill slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon’s damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level tek skill slot, plus 1d8 for each tek skill level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend.

## Alien Health

By 3rd level, the Alien tek flowing through you makes you immune to disease.

```
```

## Sacred Oath

When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a guardian forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath of Devotion, the Oath of the Ancients, or the Oath of Vengeance, all detailed at the end of the class description.

Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath tek skills and the Channel Divinity feature.

### Oath Tek Skills

Each oath has a list of associated tek skills. You gain access to these tek skills at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath tek skill, you always have it prepared. Oath tek skills don’t count against the number of tek skills you can prepare each day.

If you gain an oath tek skill that doesn’t appear on the guardian tek skill list, the tek skill is nonetheless a guardian tek skill for you.

### Channel Divinity

Your oath allows you to channel Alien energy to fuel tek effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.

When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.

Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your guardian tek skill save DC.

## Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

## Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

## Aura of Protection

Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

</div>
## Aura of Courage

Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be frightened while you are conscious.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

## Improved Alien Smite

By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry Alien power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage. If you also use your Alien Smite with an attack, you add this damage to the extra damage of your Alien Smite.

## Cleansing Touch

Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one tek skill on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.

```
```
## Sacred Oaths

Becoming a guardian involves taking vows that commit the guardian to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the guardian’s training. Some characters with this class don’t consider themselves true guardians until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the guardian’s heart.

### Oath of Devotion

The Oath of Devotion binds a guardian to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white Lancers, or holy warriors, these guardians meet the ideal of the Lancer in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods’ tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels—the perfect servants of good—as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.

\page

## Tenets of Devotion

Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, guardians of this oath share these tenets.

**_Honesty._** Don’t lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise.

**_Courage._** Never fear to act, though caution is wise.

**_Compassion._** Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom.

**_Honor._** Treat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be an example to them. Do as much good as possible while causing the least amount of harm.

**_Duty._** Be responsible for your actions and their consequences, protect those entrusted to your care, and obey those who have just authority over you.

## Oath Tek Skills

You gain oath tek skills at the guardian levels listed.

**Oath of Devotion Tek Skills (table)**

| Level | Guardian Tek Skills                           |
|-------|------------------------------------------|
| 3rd   | protection from evil and good, sanctuary |
| 5th   | lesser restoration, zone of truth        |
| 9th   | beacon of hope, dispel tek             |
| 13th  | freedom of movement, guardian of faith   |
| 17th  | commune, flame strike                    |

## Channel Divinity

When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.

**_Sacred Weapon._** As an action, you can imbue one weapon that you are holding with positive energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already tek, it becomes tek for the duration.

You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.

**_Turn the Unholy._** As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

```
```

## Aura of Devotion

Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be charmed while you are conscious.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

## Purity of Spirit

Beginning at 15th level, you are always under the effects of a *protection from evil and good* tek skill.

## Holy Nimbus

At 20th level, as an action, you can emanate an aura of sunlight. For 1 minute, bright light shines from you in a 30-foot radius, and dim light shines 30 feet beyond that.

Whenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the bright light, the creature takes 10 radiant damage.

In addition, for the duration, you have advantage on saving throws against tek skills cast by fiends or undead.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

> ## Breaking Your Oath
>
> A guardian tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous guardian is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a guardian to transgress his or her oath.
>
> A guardian who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a priest who shares his or her faith or from another guardian of the same order. The guardian might spend an all- night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the guardian starts fresh.
>
> If a guardian willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM’s discretion, an impenitent guardian might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.

#  Monk

##  Class Features

As a monk, you gain the following class features.

###  Hit Points

**Hit Dice:** 1d8 per monk level

**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution Modifier + Will modifier

**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution Modifier + Will modifier per monk level after 1st

###  Proficiencies

**Armor:** None

**Weapons:** Simple weapons, ion blades

**Tools:** Choose one type of artisan’s tools or one musical instrument

**Saving Throws:** Strength, Dexterity

**Skills:** Choose two from Acrobatics, Physique, History, Insight, and Stealth

###  Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

* (*a*) a ion blade or (*b*) any simple weapon
* (*a*) an incursion kit or (*b*) a field survival kit
* 10 darts

##  Unarmored Defense

Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding A medkit, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Will modifier.

```
```

##  Martial Arts

At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are ion blades and any simple melee weapons that don’t have the two- handed or heavy property.

You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding A medkit:

* You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.
* You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.
* When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a Bowstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn.

Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon.

##  Ki

Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table.

You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.

When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.

Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

**Ki save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

</div>
###  Flurry of Blows

Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.

###  Patient Defense

You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.

###  Step of the Wind

You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.

##  Unarmored Movement

Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding A medkit. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.

At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.

```
```

##  Monastic Tradition

When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition: the Way of the Open Hand, the Way of Shadow, or the Way of the Four Elements, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.

##  Deflect Missiles

Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.

If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.

\page

##  Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

##  Slow Fall

Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level.

##  Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

##  Stunning Strike

Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent’s body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.

##  Ki-Empowered Strikes

Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as tek for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nontek attacks and damage.

##  Evasion

At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon’s lightning breath or a *fireball* tek skill. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

##  Stillness of Mind

Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.

##  Purity of Body

At 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison.

##  Tongue of the Sun and Moon

Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say.

```
```

##  Diamond Soul

Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in all saving throws.

Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result.

##  Timeless Body

At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can’t be aged. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water.

##  Empty Body

Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage.

Additionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the *astral projection* tek skill, without needing material components. When you do so, you can’t take any other creatures with you.

##  Perfect Self

At 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki points remaining, you regain 4 ki points.

##  Monastic Traditions

Three traditions of monastic pursuit are common in the monasteries scattered across the multiverse. Most monasteries practice one tradition exclusively, but a few honor the three traditions and instruct each monk according to his or her aptitude and interest. All three traditions rely on the same basic techniques, diverging as the student grows more adept. Thus, a monk need choose a tradition only upon reaching 3rd level.

###  Way of the Open Hand

Monks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate masters of martial arts combat, whether armed or unarmed. They learn techniques to push and trip their opponents, manipulate ki to heal damage to their bodies, and practice advanced meditation that can protect them from harm.

####  Open Hand Technique

Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can manipulate your enemy’s ki when you harness your own. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target:
* It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
* It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to 15 feet away from you.
* It can’t take reactions until the end of your next turn.

\page

####  Wholeness of Body

At 6th level, you gain the ability to heal yourself. As an action, you can regain hit points equal to three times your monk level. You must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.

####  Tranquility

Beginning at 11th level, you can enter a special meditation that surrounds you with an aura of peace. At the end of a long rest, you gain the effect of a *sanctuary* tek skill that lasts until the start of your next long rest (the tek skill can end early as normal). The saving throw DC for the tek skill equals 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus.

####  Quivering Palm

At 17th level, you gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone’s body. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 ki points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your monk level. The vibrations are harmless unless you use your action to end them. To do so, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you use this action, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it is reduced to 0 hit points. If it succeeds, it takes 10d10 radiation damage.

You can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time. You can choose to end the vibrations harmlessly without using an action.

\page
#  Morph

Morphs are tekcasters who have developed their tekcasting ability to strengthen their bond with nature. What began as a group of conservationists bringing tekcasters back to earth, developed into several cult-like organizations dedicating to unlocking the secrets of nature via tek.

##  Class Features

As a morph, you gain the following class features.

###  Hit Points

**Hit Dice:** 1d8 per morph level

**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution Modifier + Will modifier

**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution Modifier + Will modifier per morph level after 1st

###  Proficiencies

**Armor:** Light armor, medium armor

**Weapons:** ion daggers, scorchers

**Tools:** Botanist's Kit

**Saving Throws:** Intelligence, Wisdom

**Skills:** Choose two from History, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Nature

###  Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

* (*a*) a stun fist (*b*) any simple weapon
* (*a*) an ion blade or (*b*) any simple melee weapon
* Flak armor, a field survival kit, and a morphic focus

##  Morphic cant

You know Morphic, the secret language of morphs. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can’t decipher it without tek.

##  Tekcasting

Drawing on the alien essence of tekcasters, you can cast tek skills to shape the essence of nature to your will.

###  Cantrips

At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the morph tek skill list. You learn additional morph cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Morph table.

```
```

###  Preparing and Casting Tek Skills

The Morph table shows how many tek skill slots you have to cast your tek skills of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these morph tek skills, you must expend a slot of the tek skill’s level or higher. You regain all expended tek skill slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of morph tek skills that are available for you to cast, choosing from the morph tek skill list. When you do so, choose a number of morph tek skills equal to your Wisdom modifier + your morph level (minimum of one tek skill). The tek skills must be of a level for which you have tek skill slots.

For example, if you are a 3rd-level morph, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level tek skill slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared tek skills can include six tek skills of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level tek skill *cure wounds,* you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the tek skill doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared tek skills.

You can also change your list of prepared tek skills when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of morph tek skills requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per tek skill level for each tek skill on your list.

##  Tekcasting Ability

Wisdom + Will is your Tekcasting ability for your morph tek skills, since your tek draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a tek skill refers to your Tekcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a morph tek skill you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Tek save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier + your Will modifier

**Tek attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier + your Will modifier

##  Ritual Casting

You can cast a morph tek skill as a ritual if that tek skill has the ritual tag and you have the tek skill prepared.

###  Tekcasting Focus

You can use a tekcaster as a focus for your morph tek skills.

##  Wild Shape

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

Your morph level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn’t have a flying or swimming speed.

**Beast Shapes (table)**

| Level | Max. CR | Limitations                 | Example     |
|-------|---------|-----------------------------|-------------|
| 2nd   | 1/4     | No flying or swimming speed | Wolf        |
| 4th   | 1/2     | No flying speed             | Crocodile   |
| 8th   | 1       | —                           | Giant eagle |

You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your morph level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.

While you are transformed, the following rules apply:

* Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.
* When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.

\page

* You can’t cast tek skills, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a tek skill you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a tek skill, such as *call lightning*, that you’ve already cast.
* You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.
* You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.

##  Morph Circle

Morphs have obtained their tek abilities from Morph Circles; cult like organizations that explore the possibilities of combining tekcasting with nature.

At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of morphs: the Circle of the Land or the Circle of the Moon, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

##  Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

##  Timeless Body

Starting at 18th level, the nature shifting tek that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.

##  Beast Tek Skills

Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your morph tek skills in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a morph tek skill while in a beast shape, but you aren’t able to provide material components.

##  Archmorph

At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times.

Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your morph tek skills, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren’t consumed by a tek skill. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.

##  Morph Circles

###  Circle of the Land

The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These morphs meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Morphic. The circle’s wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your tek is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle’s mysterious rites.

####  Bonus Cantrip

When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional morph cantrip of your choice.

####  Natural Recovery

Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your tek energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended tek skill slots to recover. The tek skill slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your morph level
(rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

For example, when you are a 4th-level morph, you can recover up to two levels worth of tek skill slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.

####  Circle Tek Skills

Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain tek skills. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle tek skills connected to the land where you became a morph. Choose that land—arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp—and consult the associated list of tek skills.

Once you gain access to a circle tek skill, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of tek skills you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a tek skill that doesn’t appear on the morph tek skill list, the tek skill is nonetheless a morph tek skill for you.

| 9th         | insect plague, scrying               |

####  Land’s Stride

Starting at 6th level, moving through nontek difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nontek plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the *entangle* tek skill.

####  Nature’s Ward

When you reach 10th level, you can’t be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease.

####  Nature’s Sanctuary

When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your morph tek skill save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.

The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you.

<br><br>

> ##  Sacred Plants and Wood
>
> A morph holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Morphs often use such plants as part of a Tekcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.
>
> Similarly, a morph uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and pulse shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for Ion Blades or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or Bowstaffs, as well as pulse shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or ion daggers.
>
> Morphs from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a morph of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.

#  Priest

##  Class Features

As a priest, you gain the following class features.

###  Hit Points

**Hit Dice:** 1d8 per priest level

**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution Modifier + Will modifier

**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution Modifier + Will modifier per priest level after 1st

###  Proficiencies

**Armor:** Light armor, medium armor, pulse shields

**Weapons:** Simple weapons

**Tools:** None

**Saving Throws:** Wisdom, Charisma

**Skills:** Choose two from History, Insight, Medicine, and Charm

###  Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

* (*a*) a scorcher or (*b*) an ion slingblade (if proficient)
* (*a*) kevlar, (*b*) Flak armor, or (*c*) scarab skin (if proficient)
* (*a*) a scorcher and 20 clips of ammunition or (*b*) any simple weapon
* (*a*) a chaplin's pack or (*b*) a field survival kit
* A medkit and a religious symbol


##  Tekcasting

As a conduit for Alien power, you can cast priest tek skills.
```
```


###  Cantrips

At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the priest tek skill list. You learn additional priest cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Priest table.

###  Preparing and Casting Tek Skills

The Priest table shows how many tek skill slots you have to cast your tek skills of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these tek skills, you must expend a slot of the tek skill’s level or higher. You regain all expended tek skill slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of priest tek skills that are available for you to cast, choosing from the priest tek skill list. When you do so, choose a number of priest tek skills equal to your Wisdom modifier + your priest level (minimum of one tek skill). The tek skills must be of a level for which you have tek skill slots.

For example, if you are a 3rd-level priest, you have four
1st-level and two 2nd-level tek skill slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared tek skills can include six tek skills of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level tek skill *cure wounds*, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the tek skill doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared tek skills.

You can change your list of prepared tek skills when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of priest tek skills requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per tek skill level for each tek skill on your list.

###  Tekcasting Ability

Wisdom + Will is your Tekcasting ability for your priest tek skills. The power of your tek skills comes from your devotion to your sect. You use your Wisdom whenever a priest tek skill refers to your Tekcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a priest tek skill you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Tek save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier + your Will modifier

**Tek attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier + your Will modifier

###  Ritual Casting

You can cast a priest tek skill as a ritual if that tek skill has the ritual tag and you have the tek skill prepared.

##  Tekcasting Focus

You can use a holy symbol (see chapter 5, “Equipment”) as a Tekcasting focus for your priest tek skills.

##  Alien Domain

Choose one domain related to your sect: Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. Each domain is detailed at the end of the class description, and each one provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you domain tek skills and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.


###  Domain Tek Skills

Each domain has a list of tek skills—its domain tek skills— that you gain at the priest levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain tek skill, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of tek skills you can prepare each day.

If you have a domain tek skill that doesn’t appear on the priest tek skill list, the tek skill is nonetheless a priest tek skill for you.

```
```

##  Channel Divinity

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel Alien energy directly from your sect, using that energy to fuel tek effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.

When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.

Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your priest tek skill save DC.

Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel

Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.

###  Channel Divinity: Turn Undead

As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

\page

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

##  Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

##  Destroy Undead

Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table.


**Destroy Undead (table)**

| Priest Level | Destroys Undead of CR... |
|--------------|--------------------------|
| 5th          | 1/2 or lower             |
| 8th          | 1 or lower               |
| 11th         | 2 or lower               |
| 14th         | 3 or lower               |
| 17th         | 4 or lower               |

##  Alien Intervention

Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your sect to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.

Imploring your sect’s aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your priest level, your sect intervenes. The GM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any priest tek skill or priest domain tek skill would be appropriate.

If your sect intervenes, you can’t use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.

At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.

##  Priest Domains

###  Life Domain

The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy—one of the fundamental forces of the universe—that sustains all life. The gods of life promote vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of death and undeath. Almost any non-evil sect can claim influence over this domain, particularly agricultural sects (such as Chauntea, Arawai, and Demeter), sun gods (such as Lathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods of healing or endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and Diancecht), and gods of home and community (such as Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrei).

**Life Domain Tek Skills (table)**

| Priest Level | Tek Skills                               |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| 1st          | bless, cure wounds                   |
| 3rd          | lesser restoration, spiritual weapon |
| 5th          | beacon of hope, revivify             |
| 7th          | death ward, guardian of faith        |
| 9th          | mass cure wounds, raise dead         |

####  Bonus Proficiency

When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor.

####  Disciple of Life

Also starting at 1st level, your healing tek skills are more effective. Whenever you use a tek skill of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the tek skill’s level.


####  Channel Divinity: Preserve Life

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to heal the badly injured.

As an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your priest level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can’t use this feature on an undead or a construct.

####  Blessed Healer

Beginning at 6th level, the healing tek skills you cast on others heal you as well. When you cast a tek skill of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the tek skill’s level.

####  Alien Strike

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with Alien energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

####  Supreme Healing

Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a tek skill, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12.

\page
#  Scion

##  Class Features

As a scion, you gain the following class features.

###  Hit Points

**Hit Dice:** 1d6 per scion level

**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 6 + your Constitution Modifier + Will modifier

**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution Modifier + Will modifier per scion level after 1st

###  Proficiencies

**Armor:** None

**Weapons:** ion daggers, scorchers

**Tools:** None

**Saving Throws:** Constitution, Charisma

**Skills:** Choose two from History, Charm, Insight, Intimidation, and Religion

###  Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
* (*a*) a scorcher and 20 clips of ammunition or (*b*) any simple weapon
* (*a*) a component pouch or (*b*) an tekcaster
* (*a*) an incursion kit or (*b*) a field survival kit
* Two ion daggers

##  Tekcasting

An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane tek. This font of tek, whatever its origin, fuels your tek skills.

###  Cantrips

At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the scion tek skill list. You learn additional scion cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Scion table.

###  Tek Slots

The Scion table shows how many tek skill slots you have to cast your tek skills of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these scion tek skills, you must expend a slot of the tek skill’s level or higher. You regain all expended tek skill slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level tek skill *burning hands* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level tek skill slot available, you can cast *burning hands* using either slot.

```
```

###  Tek Skills Known of 1st Level and Higher

You know two 1st-level tek skills of your choice from the scion tek skill list.

The Tek Skills Known column of the Scion table shows when you learn more scion tek skills of your choice. Each of these tek skills must be of a level for which you have tek skill slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new tek skill of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the scion tek skills you know and replace it with another tek skill from the scion tek skill list, which also must be of a level for which you have tek skill slots.

###  Tekcasting Ability

Charisma + Will is your Tekcasting ability for your scion tek skills, since the power of your tek relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a tek skill refers to your Tekcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a scion tek skill you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Tek save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier + your Will modifier

**Tek attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier + your Will modifier + your Wit modifier

###  Tekcasting Focus

You can use an tekcaster as a Tekcasting focus for your scion tek skills.

##  Sorcerous Origin

Choose a sorcerous origin, which describes the source of your innate tek power: Draconic Bloodline or Wild Tek, both detailed at the end of the class description.

Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.

##  Font of Tek

At 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of tek within yourself. This wellspring is represented by sorcery points, which allow you to create a variety of tek effects.

###  Sorcery Points

You have 2 sorcery points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Scion table. You can never have more sorcery points than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a long rest.

###  Flexible Casting

You can use your sorcery points to gain additional tek skill slots, or sacrifice tek skill slots to gain additional sorcery points. You learn other ways to use your sorcery points as you reach higher levels.

**_Creating Tek Slots._** You can transform unexpended sorcery points into one tek skill slot as a bonus action on your turn. The Creating Tek Slots table shows the cost of creating a tek skill slot of a given level. You can create tek skill slots no higher in level than 5th.

Any tek skill slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a long rest.

```
```

**Creating Tek Slots (table)**

| Tek Slot Level | Sorcery Point Cost |
|------------------|--------------------|
| 1st              | 2                  |
| 2nd              | 3                  |
| 3rd              | 5                  |
| 4th              | 6                  |
| 5th              | 7                  |

**_Converting a Tek Slot to Sorcery Points._** As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one tek skill slot and gain a number of sorcery points equal to the slot’s level.

\page

##  Metatek

At 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your tek skills to suit your needs. You gain two of the following Metatek options of your choice. You gain another one at 10th and 17th level.

You can use only one Metatek option on a tek skill when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.

###  Careful Tek

When you cast a tek skill that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the tek skill’s full force. To do so, you spend 1 sorcery point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the tek skill.

###  Distant Tek

When you cast a tek skill that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double the range of the tek skill.

When you cast a tek skill that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 sorcery point to make the range of the tek skill 30 feet.

###  Empowered Tek

When you roll damage for a tek skill, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls.

You can use Empowered Tek even if you have already used a different Metatek option during the casting of the tek skill.

###  Extended Tek

When you cast a tek skill that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.

###  Heightened Tek

When you cast a tek skill that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 sorcery points to give one target of the tek skill disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the tek skill.

###  Quickened Tek

When you cast a tek skill that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.

###  Subtle Tek

When you cast a tek skill, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it without any somatic or verbal components.

```
```

###  Twinned Tek

When you cast a tek skill that targets only one creature and doesn’t have a range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the tek skill’s level to target a second creature in range with the same tek skill (1 sorcery point if the tek skill is a cantrip).

To be eligible, a tek skill must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the tek skill’s current level. For example, *tek missile* and *scorching ray* aren’t eligible, but *ray of frost* and *chromatic orb* are.

##  Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

##  Sorcerous Restoration

At 20th level, you regain 4 expended sorcery points whenever you finish a short rest.

##  Sorcerous Origins

Different scions claim different origins for their innate tek. Although many variations exist, most of these origins fall into two categories: a draconic bloodline and wild tek.

###  Draconic Bloodline

Your innate tek comes from draconic tek that was mingled with your blood or that of your ancestors. Most often, scions with this origin trace their descent back to a mighty scion of ancient times who made a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent. Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are obscure. Any given scion could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance.

####  Dragon Ancestor

At 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your ancestor. The damage type associated with each dragon is used by features you gain later.

**Draconic Ancestry (table)**

| Dragon | Damage Type |
|--------|-------------|
| Black  | Acid        |
| Blue   | Shock   |
| Brass  | Fire        |
| Bronze | Shock   |
| Copper | Acid        |
| Gold   | Fire        |
| Green  | Poison      |
| Red    | Fire        |
| Silver | Cold        |
| White  | Cold        |

\page

You can speak, read, and write Draconic. Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting with dragons, your proficiency bonus is doubled if it applies to the check.

####  Draconic Resilience

As tek flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.

Additionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of dragon-like scales. When you aren’t wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.

####  Elemental Affinity

Starting at 6th level, when you cast a tek skill that deals damage of the type associated with your draconic ancestry, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that tek skill. At the same time, you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain resistance to that damage type for 1 hour.

####  Dragon Wings

At 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed. You can create these wings as a bonus action on your turn. They last until you dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn.

You can’t manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them.

####  Draconic Presence

Beginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread presence of your dragon ancestor, causing those around you to become awestruck or frightened. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration tek skill), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose fear) until the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to your aura for 24 hours.

\page
#  Scoundrel

##  Class Features

As a scoundrel, you have the following class features.

###  Hit Points

**Hit Dice:** 1d8 per scoundrel level

**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution Modifier + Will modifier

**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution Modifier + Will modifier per scoundrel level after 1st

###  Proficiencies

**Armor:** Light armor

**Weapons:** Simple weapons, scorchers, ion blades, pulse blades

**Tools:** Thieves’ tools

**Saving Throws:** Dexterity, Intelligence

**Skills:** Choose four from Acrobatics, Computers, History, Physique, Charm, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Perception, Performance, Trickery, and Stealth

###  Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
* (*a*) an ion blade or (*b*) a ion blade
* (*a*) a scorcher and 20 clips of ammunition or (*b*) a ion blade
* (*a*) a slicer's kit, (*b*) an incursion kit, or (*c*) a field survival kit
* (*a*) Flak armor, two ion daggers, and thieves’ tools

##  Expertise

At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves’ tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.

At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves’ tools) to gain this benefit.

##  Stealth Attack

Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.

You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.

The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Stealth Attack column of the Scoundrel table.

```
```

##  Thieves’ Cant

During your scoundrel training you learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.

In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.

##  Cunning Action

Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

##  Roguish Archetype

At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your scoundrel abilities: Thief, Assassin, or Arcane Trickster, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.

##  Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

##  Uncanny Dodge

Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you.

##  Evasion

Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon’s fiery breath or an *ice storm* tek skill. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

##  Reliable Talent

By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

</div>
##  Blindsense

Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.

##  Slippery Mind

By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.

##  Elusive

Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren’t incapacitated.

##  Stroke of Luck

At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

```
```

##  Roguish Archetypes

Scoundrels have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different scoundrels steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the scoundrel archetypes. Your choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus—not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a description of your preferred techniques.

###  Thief

You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, Space Pirates, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do scoundrels who prefer to think of themselves as professional loot seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using alien artifacts you normally couldn’t employ.

####  Fast Hands

Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Trickery) check, use your thieves’ tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action.

\page

####  Second-Story Work

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement.

In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.

####  Supreme Stealth

Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.

####  Use Tek Device

By 13th level, you have learned enough about the workings of tek that you can improvise the use of items even when they are not intended for you. You ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use of alien artifacts.

####  Thief’s Reflexes

When you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can’t use this feature when you are surprised.

\page
#  Scout
Modern scouts are very different from those of the past. Today scouts must be versatile enough to track a quarry within the metal hulls of spacecraft or space stations, and in the many types of environment found planet-side on the many habitable planets and moons. Scouts specialize in ranged and martial combat, and employ the use of tekcasting to enhance their combat viability.

##  Class Features

As a scout, you gain the following class features.

###  Hit Points

**Hit Dice:** 1d10 per scout level

**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 10 + your Constitution Modifier + Will modifier

**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution Modifier + Will modifier per scout level after 1st

###  Proficiencies

**Armor:** Light armor, medium armor, pulse shields

**Weapons:** Simple weapons, martial weapons

**Tools:** None

**Saving Throws:** Strength, Dexterity

**Skills:** Choose three from Computers, Nature, Physique, History, Insight, Investigation, Perception, and Stealth

* (*a*) an incursion kit or (*b*) a field survival kit
* A martial ranged weapon and 20 clips of ammunition

##  Favored Enemy

Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy.

Choose a type of favored enemy: aliens, aberrations, beasts, Aliens, robots, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two factions of humans as favored enemies.

You have advantage on Wisdom (Nature) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.

When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.

You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures.

##  Natural Explorer

You are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of favored terrain: null-g, arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you’re proficient in.

While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits:
* Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel.
* Your group can’t become lost except by tek means.
* Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.
* If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.
* When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.
* While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.

You choose additional favored terrain types at 6th and 10th level.

##  Fighting Style

At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

###  Gunnery

You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

###  Defense

While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

###  Dueling

When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

###  Two-Weapon Fighting

When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

##  Tekcasting

By the time you reach 2nd level, you have trained to use a tekcaster to cast tek skills

</div>
###  Tek Slots

The Scout table shows how many tek skill slots you have to cast your tek skills of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these tek skills, you must expend a slot of the tek skill’s level or higher. You regain all expended tek skill slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level tek skill *animal friendship* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level tek skill slot available, you can cast *animal friendship* using either slot.

####  Tek Skills Known of 1st Level and Higher

You know two 1st-level tek skills of your choice from the scout tek skill list.

The Tek Skills Known column of the Scout table shows when you learn more scout tek skills of your choice. Each of these tek skills must be of a level for which you have tek skill slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new tek skill of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the scout tek skills you know and replace it with another tek skill from the scout tek skill list, which also must be of a level for which you have tek skill slots.

```
```

###  Tekcasting Ability

Wisdom + Will is your Tekcasting ability for your scout tek skills, since your tek draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a tek skill refers to your Tekcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a scout tek skill you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Tek save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier + your Will modifier

**Tek attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier + your Will modifier

###  Scout Archetype

At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate: Hunter or Beast Master, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.

\page

###  Scout Drone

Beginning at 3rd level, you can deploy a Scout Drone that lasts 10 minutes. It is spherical in shape, about 1 inch in diameter. It gets +5 to Stealth checks. As an action you can give the drone movement instructions through your datapad. As a bonus action you can view the drone's' camera and microphone feed through your datapad. After 10 minutes, the drone's battery dies, and unless in null-g, it falls to the ground. If the drone is destroyed, you must spend a long rest in order to repair it. Otherwise it becomes fully charged at the end of a short rest.

###  Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

###  Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

###  Spacer Agility

Starting at 8th level, you take no movement penalty for moving in null gravity.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against objects that are created or manipulated to impede movement.

###  Improved Scout Drone

Starting at 10th level, your scouting drone lasts 1 hour, and can be repaired over a short rest, and is cloaked, requiring a DC 15 Perception check to be seen.

###  Vanish

Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can’t be tracked by nontek means, unless you choose to leave a trail.

###  Feral Senses

At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can’t see. When you attack a creature you can’t see, your inability to see it doesn’t impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.

You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn’t hidden from you and you aren’t blinded or deafened.

###  Foe Slayer

At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.

```
```

##  Scout Archetypes

The ideal of the scout has two classic expressions: the Hunter and the Beast Master.

####  Sharpshooter

####  Hunter’s Prey

At 3rd level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

**_Assassin._** Your tenacity can wear down the most potent foes. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage if it’s below its hit point maximum. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn.

**_Giant Killer._** When a Large or larger creature within 5 feet of you hits or misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to attack that creature immediately after its attack, provided that you can see the creature.

**_Horde Breaker._** Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target and within range of your weapon.

####  Defensive Tactics

At 7th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

**_Escape the Horde._** Opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage.

**_Multiattack Defense._** When a creature hits you with an attack, you gain a +4 bonus to AC against all subsequent attacks made by that creature for the rest of the turn.

**_Steel Will._** You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.

####  Multiattack

At 11th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

**_Volley._** You can use your action to make a ranged attack against any number of creatures within 10 feet of a point you can see within your weapon’s range. You must have ammunition for each target, as normal, and you make a separate attack roll for each target.

**_Whirlwind Attack._** You can use your action to make a melee attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each target.

####  Superior Hunter’s Defense

At 15th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

**_Evasion._** When you are subjected to an effect, such as  *lightning bolt* tek skill, that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

**_Stand Against the Tide._** When a hostile creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to repeat the same attack against another creature (other than itself) of your choice.

**_Uncanny Dodge._** When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you.

\page

**Commander’s Strike**
When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one of your attacks and use a bonus action to direct one of your companions to strike.

\page

###  Maneuvers

**Disarming Attack**
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it’s holding.

**Feinting Attack**

<!-- Backgrounds -->

### Backgrounds

Every story has a beginning. Your character’s background reveals where you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the world. Your soldier might have been a courageous Lancer or a grizzled soldier. Your Arcanist could have been a sage or an artisan. Your scoundrel might have gotten by as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a jester.

Choosing a background provides you with important story cues about your character’s identity. The most important question to ask about your background is *what changed*? Why did you stop doing whatever your background describes and start adventuring? Where did you get the money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why don’t you have *more* money? How did you learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share your background?

The sample backgrounds in this chapter provide both concrete benefits (features, proficiencies, and languages) and roleplaying suggestions.

##### Proficiencies

Each background gives a character proficiency in two skills (described in “Using Ability Scores”).

In addition, most backgrounds give a character proficiency with one or more tools (detailed in “Equipment”).

If a character would gain the same proficiency from two different sources, he or she can choose a different proficiency of the same kind (skill or tool) instead.

##### Languages

Some backgrounds also allow characters to learn additional languages beyond those given by race. See “Languages.”

##### Equipment

Each background provides a package of starting equipment. If you use the optional rule to spend coin on gear, you do not receive the starting equipment from your background.

##### Suggested Characteristics

A background contains suggested personal characteristics based on your background. You can pick characteristics, roll dice to determine them randomly, or use the suggestions as inspiration for characteristics of your own creation.

##### Customizing a Background

You might want to tweak some of the features of a background so it better fits your character or the campaign setting. To customize a background, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose any two skills, and choose a total of two tool proficiencies or languages from the sample backgrounds. You can either use the equipment package from your background or spend coin on gear as described in the equipment section. (If you spend coin, you can’t also take the equipment package suggested for your class.) Finally, choose two personality traits, one ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you can’t find a feature that matches your desired background, work with your GM to create one.

**Entrepreneur**: You are skilled at making business deals. You do all your business through a small corporation you chose a name for. You have 3 employees that run this small business for you. The business does not turn a profit unless you invest time and money into a business venture. The business can be any type of legal small business. The business venture can be anything legal or illegal. You must fund the venture directly by investing credits and making the appropriate business connections. The success of the venture is determined by a number of appropriate ability checks determined by the DM. Results can range from capital gains/losses, earned/ruined business relationships, to even legal trouble, or disputes with elite houses/corporations. Once you make the proposal and appropriate connections, the length of the business venture, the difficulty, and potential outcomes will be determined by the DM.

### Multiclassing

Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options.

With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining a level in your current class. Your levels in all your classes are added together to determine your character level. For example, if you have three levels in Arcanist and two in soldier, you’re a 5th-level character.

As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of your original class with just a few levels in another class, or you might change course entirely, never looking back at the class you left behind. You might even start progressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to a single-class character of the same level, you’ll sacrifice some focus in exchange for versatility.

#### Prerequisites

To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your new one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For example, a brute who decides to multiclass into the morph class must have both Strength and Wisdom scores of 13 or higher. Without the full training that a beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in your new class, having a natural aptitude that is reflected by higher- than-average ability scores.

**Multiclassing Prerequisites (table)**

| Class     | Ability Score Minimum       |
|-----------|-----------------------------|
| Brute | Strength 3                 |
| Evangelist      | Charisma 3                 |
| Priest    | Wisdom 3                   |
| Morph     | Wisdom 3                   |
| Soldier   | Strength 3 or Dexterity 3 |
| Monk      | Dexterity 3 and Wisdom 3  |
| Guardian   | Strength 3 and Charisma 3 |
| Scout    | Dexterity 3 and Wisdom 3  |
| Scoundrel     | Dexterity 3                |
| Scion  | Charisma 3                 |
| Cybernetic   | Charisma 3                 |
| Arcanist    | Intelligence 3             |

#### Experience Points

The experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table, not your level in a particular class. So, if you are a priest 6/soldier 1, you must gain enough XP to reach 8th level before you can take your second level as a soldier or your seventh level as a priest.

#### Hit Points and Hit Dice

You gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a class only when you are a 1st-level character.

You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can simply pool them together. For example, both the soldier and the guardian have a d10, so if you are a guardian 5/soldier 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them separately. If you are a guardian 5/priest 5, for example, you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d8 Hit Dice.

### Proficiency Bonus

Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table in chapter 1, not your level in a particular class. For example, if you are a soldier 3/scoundrel 2, you have the proficiency bonus of a 5th- level character, which is +3.

### Proficiencies

When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of new class’s starting proficiencies, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.

**Multiclassing Proficiencies (table)**

| Class     | Proficiencies Gained                                                                                       |

| Soldier   | Light armor, medium armor, pulse shields, simple weapons, martial weapons                                        |

| Scion  | —                                                                                                          |
| Cybernetic   | Light armor, simple weapons                                                                                |
| Arcanist    | —                                                                                                          |

#### Class Features

When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don’t, however, receive the class’s starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you’re multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Tekcasting.

\page

##### Channel Divinity

If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn’t give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a priest 6/guardian 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the priest class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.

##### Extra Attack

If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don’t add together. You can’t make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the soldier’s version of Extra Attack does). Similarly, the cybernetic’s nanotech invocation Thirsting Blade doesn’t give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.

##### Unarmored Defense

If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can’t gain it again from another class.

##### Tekcasting

Your capacity for Tekcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your Tekcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Tekcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Tekcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

**_Tek Skills Known and Prepared._** You determine what tek skills you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a scout 4/Arcanist 3, for example, you know three 1st-level scout tek skills based on your levels in the scout class. As 3rd-level Arcanist, you know three Arcanist cantrips, and your tek skill datapad contains ten Arcanist tek skills, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as an arcanist) can be 2nd-level tek skills. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six Arcanist tek skills from your tek skill datapad.

Each tek skill you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the Tekcasting ability of that class when you cast the tek skill. Similarly, a Tekcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the tek skills from the class associated with that focus.

**_Tek Slots._** You determine your available tek skill slots by adding together all your levels in the evangelist, priest, morph, scion, and Arcanist classes, and half your levels (rounded down) in the guardian and scout classes. Use this total to determine your tek skill slots by consulting the Multiclass Tekcaster table.

If you have more than one Tekcasting class, this table might give you tek skill slots of a level that is higher than the tek skills you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level tek skills. If a lower-level tek skill that you cast, like _burning hands_, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don’t have any tek skills of that higher level.

For example, if you are the aforementioned scout 4/Arcanist 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your tek skill slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don’t know any 3rd-level tek skills, nor do you know any 2nd-level scout tek skills. You can use the tek skill slots of those levels to cast the tek skills you do know—and potentially enhance their effects.

**_Link Tek._** If you have both the Tekcasting class feature and the Link Tek class feature from the cybernetic class, you can use the tek skill slots you gain from the Link Tek feature to cast tek skills you know or have prepared from classes with the Tekcasting class feature, and you can use the tek skill slots you gain from the Tekcasting class feature to cast cybernetic tek skills you know.

<!-- Leveling Up -->

## Beyond 1st Level

---

<div class="wide">
As your character goes on adventures and overcomes challenges, he or she gains experience, represented by experience points. A character who reaches a specified experience point total advances in capability. This advancement is called **gaining a level**.

When your character gains a level, his or her class often grants additional features, as detailed in the class description. Some of these features allow you to increase your ability scores, either increasing two scores by 1 each or increasing one score by 2. You can’t increase an ability score above 20. In addition, every character’s proficiency bonus increases at certain levels.

Each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die. Roll that Hit Die, add your Constitution modifier to the roll, and add the total to your hit point maximum. Alternatively, you can use the fixed value shown in your class entry, which is the average result of the die roll (rounded up).

When your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained. For example, if your 7th-level soldier has a Constitution score of 18, when he reaches 8th level, he increases his Constitution score from 17 to 18, thus increasing his Constitution modifier from +3 to +4. His hit point maximum then increases by 8.

The Character Advancement table summarizes the XP you need to advance in levels from level 1 through level 20, and the proficiency bonus for a character of that level. Consult the information in your character’s class description to see what other improvements you gain at each level.

## Character Advancement

## Equipment
---

Currency is mostly dealt with in digital credits, however coins are still in circulation.

With one 100 credits, a character can buy a bedroll, 50 carbon fiber rope, or a low end datapad. A skilled (but not exceptional) worker can earn 100 credits a day.

50 credits buys a laborer’s work for half a day, a night in a low end hostel, or a few rounds of drinks at a pub.

A single credit buys a pack of gum, small flashlight, or a bottle of water.

Coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.

**Standard Exchange Rates (table)**

| Coin          | Credits |
|---------------|-------|
| Copper (cp)   | 1     |
| Silver (sp)   | 10    |
| Gold (gp)     | 100   |
| Platinum (pp) | 1,000 |

### Selling Loot

Opportunities abound to find loot, equipment, weapons, armor, and more in the dungeons you explore. Normally, you can sell your loot and trinkets when you return to a town or other colony, provided that you can find buyers and merchants interested in your loot.

**_Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment._** As a general rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch half their cost when sold in a market. Weapons and armor used by raiders are rarely in good enough condition to sell.

**_Alien Artifacts._** Selling alien artifacts is problematic. Finding someone to buy a potion or a datacube isn’t too hard, but other items are out of the realm of most but the wealthiest nobles. Likewise, aside from a few common alien artifacts, you won’t normally come across alien artifacts or tek skills to purchase. The value of tek is far beyond simple gold and should always be treated as such.

**_Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects._** These items retain their full value in the marketplace, and you can either trade them in for coin or use them as currency for other transactions. For exceptionally valuable loot, the GM might require you to find a buyer in a large town or larger community first.

**_Trade Goods._** In the black abyss, many people conduct transactions through barter. Like gems and art objects, trade rare minerals, water, livestock, and so on—retain their full value in the market and can be used as currency.

<!-- Armor -->
\page
### Armor

Fantasy gaming worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many different cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from Flak armor to scarab skin to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and separates them into three categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor with A Pulse Shields.

The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor worn in futuristic gaming worlds.

**_Armor Proficiency._** Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap A Pulse Shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor’s use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can’t cast tek skills.

**_Armor Class (AC)._** Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class.

**_Heavy Armor._** Heavier armor interferes with the wearer’s ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows “Str 13” or “Str 15” in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the wearer’s speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.

**_Stealth._** If the Armor table shows “Disadvantage” in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

**_Pulse Shields._** A Pulse Shields is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding A Pulse Shields increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.

#### Light Armor

Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.

**_Flak Armor._** Lightweight metal lined combat armor.

**_Pulse Armor._** Powered by a small generator, this expensive shielding deflects projectiles. Once depleted it takes time to recharge. Pulse armor can be quite expensive, but ideal if you are trying to keep a low profile.

#### Medium Armor

Medium armor offers more protection than light armor, but it also impairs movement more. If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.

**_Scarab Skin._** Made of interlocking metal rings, a scarab skin is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This armor offers modest protection to the wearer’s upper body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against one another to be muffled by outer layers.

**_Kevlar._** Basic military issue combat armor.

#### Heavy Armor

Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk.

Heavy armor doesn’t let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn’t penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative.

**_Power Shell._** Heavy and cumbersome, this powered mech armor gives the wearer enhanced strength, and a tough shell more resistant to damage than the standard pulse armor. However it makes it very difficult to be stealthy. This armor gives the wearer +2 Strength.

| Pulse Shield             | 10000 credits    | +2                        | —        | —            | 6 kg.  |1 action|


#### Getting Into and Out of Armor

The time it takes to don or doff armor depends on the armor’s category.

**_Don._** This is the time it takes to put on armor. You benefit from the armor’s AC only if you take the full time to don the suit of armor.

**_Doff._** This is the time it takes to take off armor. If you have help, reduce this time by half.

### Weapons

Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class’s focus and the tools you are most likely to use. Whether you favor a pulse blade or a rail rifle, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring.

The Weapons table shows the most common weapons used in the futuristic gaming worlds, their price and weight, the damage they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. Every weapon is classified as either melee or ranged. A **melee weapon** is used to attack a target within 5 feet of you, whereas a **ranged weapon** is used to attack a target at a distance.

#### Weapon Proficiency

Your race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The two categories are **simple** and **martial**. Most people can use simple weapons with proficiency. These weapons include clubs, maces, and other weapons often found in the hands of commoners. Martial weapons, including swords and axes, require more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial weapons because these weapons put their fighting style and training to best use.

Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.

## Weapon Types

### Ion Weapons

Straight bladed weapons forged with modern day technology are much stronger than the steel blades once used on Earth. Their molecular structure makes them better for getting through weaker pulse armor.

### Pulse Weapons

Powered melee weapons designed to puncture through modern armor.

#### Weapon Properties

Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.

**_Ammunition._** You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Once your clip runs out of ammunition, you have to spend an action to reload.

If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see “Improvised Weapons” later in the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

**_Finesse._** When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

**_Heavy._** Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon’s size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively. Light. A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

**_Burst-Fire._** Weapons with this trait fire multiple rounds of ammunition per round. You roll once to hit, but roll damage separately for each round of ammunition.

**_Loading._** Weapons with this trait need to be reloaded after firing a certain number of times. For example a Rail Rifle fires 3 rounds of ammunition per round, and requires to be reloaded every 10 attacks, meaning its clips hold 30 rounds of ammunition.

**_Range._** A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon’s long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can’t attack a target beyond the weapon’s long range.

**_Reach._** This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

**_Special._** A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon’s description (see “Special Weapons” later in this section).

**_Thrown._** If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw an ion dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the ion dagger has the finesse property.

**_Two-Handed._** This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

**_Versatile._** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

**_Hidden._** This weapon can be disguised as an ordinary object with a Stealth check. It takes a bonus action to unsheathe.

##### Improvised Weapons

Sometimes characters don’t have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead goblin.

Often, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the GM’s option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.

An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the GM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.

\page

##### Special Weapons

Weapons with special rules are described here.

**_Razer._** This weapon can be toggled between whip form and rapier form using a bonus action. As a rapier it is a Finesse weapon that does 1d8 piercing. As a whip it has Reach, and does 1d4 slashing.

**_Pulse Fist._** Has advantage on targets using Pulse Shielding.

**_Pulse Net._** A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 concussive damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net.

When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

### Adventuring Gear

This section describes items that have special rules or require further explanation.

**_Grenade._** Throw at a location within 30 feet. Creatures within 5 feet must make a dexterity 14 saving throw or take damage based on the grenade's type. Types: Incendiary, Radiation, Cryo,

**_Antitoxin._** A creature that drinks this vial of liquid gains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to undead or synthetics.

**_Datacube._** A cube 1 inch on each side that can store up to 1 zettabyte of information.

**_Caltrops._** As an action, you can spread a bag of caltrops to cover a square area that is 5 feet on a side. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving this turn and take 1 piercing damage. Taking this damage reduces the creature’s walking speed by 10 feet until the creature regains at least 1 hit point. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn’t need to make the save.

**_Chain._** A chain has 10 hit points. It can be burst with a successful DC 20 Strength check.

**_Climber’s Kit._** A climber’s kit includes special pitons, boot tips, gloves, and a harness. You can use the climber’s kit as an action to anchor yourself; when you do, you can’t fall more than 25 feet from the point where you anchored yourself, and you can’t climb more than 25 feet away from that point without undoing the anchor.

**_Datapad._** An all purpose personal digital assistant. Used for storing information, and accessing data networks. Also a required tool for slicers. A datapad can last up to 2 weeks before it needs to be charged over a long rest.

**_Fishing Tackle._** This kit includes a wooden rod, silken line, corkwood bobbers, steel hooks, lead sinkers, velvet lures, and netting.

**Med Kit._** This kit is a pouch containing bandages, salves, splints, antibiotics, and a defibrillator. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Medicine check.

**_Hunting Trap._** When you use your action to set it, this trap forms a saw-toothed steel ring that snaps shut when a creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage and stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals 1 piercing damage to the trapped creature.

**_Flashlight._** A flashlight casts bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. It's battery lasts 18 hours before needing to be recharged.

**_Flashlight Attachment._** A flashlight attachment can be attached to the side of most firearms.

**_Handcuffs_** These metal restraints can bind a Small or Medium creature. Escaping the manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. Breaking them requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. Each set of manacles comes with one key. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves’ tools can pick the manacles’ lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Manacles have 15 hit points.

**_Mess Kit._** This tin box contains a cup and simple cutlery. The box clamps together, and one side can be used as a cooking pan and the other as a plate or shallow bowl.

**_Poison, Basic._** You can use the poison in this vial to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammunition must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying.

**_Potion of Healing._** A character who drinks the tek red fluid in this vial regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. Drinking or administering a potion takes an action.

**_Pouch._** A cloth or leather pouch can hold small objects such as clips of ammunition.

**_Ram, Portable._** You can use a portable ram to break down doors. When doing so, you gain a +4 bonus on the Strength check. One other character can help you use the ram, giving you advantage on this check.

### Tools

A tool helps you to do something you couldn't otherwise do, such as craft or repair an item, forge a document, or pick a lock. Your race, class, background, or feats give you proficiency with certain tools. Proficiency with a tool allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make using that tool. Tool use is not tied to a single ability, since proficiency with a tool represents broader knowledge of its use. For example, the GM might ask you to make a Dexterity check to carve a fine detail with your woodcarver’s tools, or a Strength check to make something out of particularly hard wood.

```
```

### Expenses

When not descending into the depths of space, exploring ruins for lost loot, or waging war against the encroaching darkness, adventurers face more mundane realities. Even in a futuristic world, people require basic necessities such as shelter, sustenance, and clothing. These things cost money, although some lifestyles cost more than others.

#### Lifestyle Expenses

Lifestyle expenses provide you with a simple way to account for the cost of living in a futuristic world. They cover your accommodations, food and drink, and all your other necessities. Furthermore, expenses cover the cost of maintaining your equipment so you can be ready when adventure next calls.

At the start of each week or month (your choice), choose a lifestyle from the Expenses table and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle. The prices listed are per day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of your chosen lifestyle over a thirty-day period, multiply the listed price by 30. Your lifestyle might change from one period to the next, based on the funds you have at your disposal, or you might maintain the same lifestyle throughout your character’s career.

Your lifestyle choice can have consequences. Maintaining a wealthy lifestyle might help you make contacts with the rich and powerful, though you run the risk of attracting thieves. Likewise, living frugally might help you avoid criminals, but you are unlikely to make powerful connections.

**Lifestyle Expenses (table)**

| Lifestyle    | Price/Day     |
|--------------|---------------|
| Wretched     | —             |
| Squalid      | 1000 credits         |
| Poor         | 2000 credits         |
| Modest       | 100 credits          |
| Comfortable  | 200 credits          |
| Wealthy      | 400 credits          |
| Aristocratic | 1000 credits minimum |

**_Wretched._** You live in inhumane conditions. With no place to call home, you shelter wherever you can, Stealthing into barns, huddling in old crates, and relying on the good graces of people better off than you. A wretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched people covet your armor, weapons, and adventuring gear, which represent a fortune by their standards. You are beneath the notice of most people.

**_Squalid._** You live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut just outside town, or a vermin-infested boarding house in the worst part of town. You have shelter from the elements, but you live in a desperate and often violent environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and misfortune. You are beneath the notice of most people, and you have few legal protections. Most people at this lifestyle level have suffered some terrible setback. They might be disturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer from disease.

**_Poor._** A poor lifestyle means going without the comforts available in a stable community. Simple food and lodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant, experience. Your accommodations might be a room in a flophouse or in the common room above a tavern. You benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to contend with violence, crime, and disease. People at this lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, costermongers, peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and other disreputable types.

**_Modest._** A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums and ensures that you can maintain your equipment. You live in an older part of town, renting a room in a boarding house, inn, or temple. You don’t go hungry or thirsty, and your living conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary people living modest lifestyles include soldiers with families, laborers, students, priests, hedge Arcanists, and the like.

**_Comfortable._** Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily maintain your equipment. You live in a small cottage in a middle-class neighborhood or in a private room at a fine inn. You associate with merchants, skilled tradespeople, and military officers.

**_Wealthy._** Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a life of luxury, though you might not have achieved the social status associated with the old money of nobility or royalty. You live a lifestyle comparable to that of a highly successful merchant, a favored servant of the royalty, or the owner of a few small businesses. You have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a good part of town or a comfortable suite at a fine inn. You likely have a small staff of servants.

**_Aristocratic._** You live a life of plenty and comfort. You move in circles populated by the most powerful people in the community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps a townhouse in the nicest part of town or rooms in the finest inn. You dine at the best restaurants, retain the most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants attending to your every need. You receive invitations to the social gatherings of the rich and powerful, and spend evenings in the company of politicians, guild leaders, high priests, and nobility. You must also contend with the highest levels of deceit and treachery. The wealthier you are, the greater the chance you will be drawn into political intrigue as a pawn or participant.

> ##### Self-Sufficiency
>
> The expenses and lifestyles described here assume that you are spending your time between adventures in town, availing yourself of whatever services you can afford—paying for food and shelter, paying townspeople to sharpen your sword and repair your armor, and so on. Some characters, though, might prefer to spend their time away from civilization, sustaining themselves in the wild by hunting, foraging, and repairing their own gear.
>
> Maintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn’t require you to spend any coin, but it is time-consuming. If you spend your time between adventures practicing a profession, you can eke out the equivalent of a poor lifestyle. Proficiency in the Nature skill lets you live at the equivalent of a comfortable lifestyle.

#### Services

Adventurers can pay nonplayer characters to assist them or act on their behalf in a variety of circumstances. Most such hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while others are masters of a craft or art, and a few are experts with specialized adventuring skills.

Some of the most basic types of hirelings appear on the Services table. Other common hirelings include any of the wide variety of people who inhabit a typical town or city, when the adventurers pay them to perform a specific task. For example, an arcanist might pay a carpenter to construct an elaborate chest (and its miniature replica) for use in the *secret chest* tek skill. A soldier might commission a blacksmith to forge a special sword. A evangelist might pay a tailor to make exquisite clothing for an upcoming performance in front of the duke.

Other hirelings provide more expert or dangerous services. Mercenary soldiers paid to help the adventurers take on a hobgoblin army are hirelings, as are sages hired to research ancient or esoteric lore. If a high-level adventurer establishes a stronghold of some kind, he or she might hire a whole staff of servants and agents to run the place, from a castellan or steward to menial laborers to keep the stables clean. These hirelings often enjoy a long-term contract that includes a place to live within the stronghold as part of the offered compensation.

Skilled hirelings include anyone hired to perform a service that involves a proficiency (including weapon, tool, or skill): a mercenary, artisan, scribe, and so on. The pay shown is a minimum; some expert hirelings require more pay. Untrained hirelings are hired for menial work that requires no particular skill and can include laborers, porters, maids, and similar workers.

**Services (table)**

| Service Pay       | Pay           |
|-------------------|---------------|
| **_Coach cab_**   |               |
| - Between towns   | 30 credits per mile |
| - Within a city   | 10 credits          |
| **_Hireling_**    |               |
| - Skilled         | 200 credits per day  |
| - Untrained       | 2000 credits per day  |
| Messenger         | 20 credits per mile |
| Road or gate toll | 10 credits          |
| Ship’s passage    | 10,000 credits per day |

#### Tekcasting Services

People who are able to cast tek skills don’t fall into the category of ordinary hirelings. It might be possible to find someone willing to cast a tek skill in exchange for coin or favors, but it is rarely easy and no established pay rates exist. As a rule, the higher the level of the desired tek skill, the harder it is to find someone who can cast it and the more it costs.

Hiring someone to cast a relatively common tek skill of 1st or 2nd level, such as *cure wounds* or *identify*, is easy enough in a city or town, and might cost 10 to 50 gold pieces (plus the cost of any expensive material components). Finding someone able and willing to cast a higher-level tek skill might involve traveling to a large city, perhaps one with a university or prominent temple. Once found, the tekcaster might ask for a service instead of payment—the kind of service that only adventurers can provide, such as retrieving a rare item from a dangerous locale or traversing a monster-infested wilderness to deliver something important to a distant colony.

<!-- Feats -->
\page
## Feats

---

A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides.

At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat’s description says otherwise.

You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat’s prerequisite, you can’t use that feat until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Grappler feat requires you to have a Strength of 13 or higher. If your Strength is reduced below 13 somehow—perhaps by a withering hack—you can’t benefit from the Grappler feat until your Strength is restored.

<!-- Core Mechanics -->
\page
### Advantage and Disadvantage

Sometimes a special ability or tek skill tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll. When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.

If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don’t roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.

If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.

You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, or tek skills. Inspiration can also give a character advantage. The

GM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.

### Proficiency Bonus

Characters have a proficiency bonus determined by level. Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.

Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when you make the save.

Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. For example, the scoundrel’s Expertise feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability checks. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and multiply or divide it only once.

By the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn’t normally benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don’t add the bonus to the check. For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if you lack proficiency in the History skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence (History) checks.

In general, you don’t multiply your proficiency bonus for attack rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect allows you to do so, these same rules apply.

#### Contests

Sometimes one character’s or monster’s efforts are directly opposed to another’s. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a tek ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal— for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.

Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding.

If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that the door remains shut.

##### Attack Rolls and Damage

You add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as a scorcher, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand* to-hand combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack.

##### Lifting and Carrying

Your Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.

**_Carrying Capacity._** Your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that most characters don’t usually have to worry about it.

**_Push, Drag, or Lift._** You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.

**_Size and Strength._** Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the creature’s carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.

##### Variant: Encumbrance

The rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple. Here is a variant if you are looking for more detailed rules for determining how a character is hindered by the weight of equipment. When you use this variant, ignore the Strength column of the Armor table.

If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are **encumbered**, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.

\page

If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are instead **heavily encumbered**, which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.


##### Armor Class

Depending on the armor you wear, you might add some or all of your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class.

##### Initiative

At the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making a Dexterity check. Initiative determines the order of creatures’ turns in combat.

> #### Hiding
>
> The DM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check’s total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.
>
>You can’t hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase.
>
>An invisible creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.
>
>In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the DM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.
>
> **_Passive Perception._** When you hide, there’s a chance someone will notice you even if they aren’t searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the DM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature’s Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. For example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 14.
>
> **_What Can You See?**_ One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be **lightly** or **heavily obscured**, as explained in chapter 8, “Adventuring.”

##### Hit Points

Your Toughness modifier contributes to your hit points. Typically, you add your Toughness modifier to each Hit Die you roll for your hit points.

```
```
##### Tekcasting Ability

Evangelists, guardians, scions, and cybernetics use Charisma and Will as their Tekcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of tek skills they cast.

### Saving Throws

A saving throw—also called a save—represents an attempt to resist a tek skill, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don’t normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one because your character or monster is at risk of harm.

To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. For example, you use your Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity saving throw.

A saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and can be affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined by the GM.

Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The Arcanist, for example, is proficient in Intelligence saves. As with skill proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or her proficiency bonus to saving throws made using a particular ability score. Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well.

The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a tek skill is determined by the caster’s Tekcasting ability and proficiency bonus.

The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in the effect that allows the save. Usually, a successful save means that a creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.

### Time

In situations where keeping track of the passage of time is important, the GM determines the time a task requires. The GM might use a different time scale depending on the context of the situation at hand. In a dungeon environment, the adventurers’ movement happens on a scale of **minutes**. It takes them about a minute to creep down a long hallway, another minute to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes to search the chamber beyond for anything interesting or valuable.

In a city or wilderness, a scale of **hours** is often more appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower at the heart of the forest hurry across those fifteen miles in just under four hours’ time.

For long journeys, a scale of **days** works best.

Following the road from Baldur’s Gate to Waterdeep, the adventurers spend four uneventful days before a goblin ambush interrupts their journey.

In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on **rounds**, a 6-second span of time.

\page

### Movement

Swimming across a rushing river, Stealthing down a dungeon corridor, scaling a treacherous mountain slope—all sorts of movement play a key role in futuristic gaming adventures.

The GM can summarize the adventurers’ movement without calculating exact distances or travel times: “You travel through the forest and find the dungeon entrance late in the evening of the third day.” Even in a dungeon, particularly a large dungeon or a cave network, the GM can summarize movement between encounters: “After killing the guardian at the entrance to the ancient dwarven stronghold, you consult your map, which leads you through miles of echoing corridors to a chasm bridged by a nbullet stone arch.”

Sometimes it’s important, though, to know how long it takes to get from one spot to another, whether the answer is in days, hours, or minutes. The rules for determining travel time depend on two factors: the speed and travel pace of the creatures moving and the terrain they’re moving over.

#### Speed

Every character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in feet that the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life* threatening situation.

The following rules determine how far a character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.

##### Travel Pace

While traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to Stealth around and to search an area more carefully.

**_Forced March._** The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.

For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion (see appendix A).

**_Mounts and Vehicles._** For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.

Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel, and they don’t suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.

Certain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, or special vehicles, such as a *carpet of flying*, allow you to travel more swiftly.

**Travel Pace (table)**

| Pace   | Distance per: Minute | Hour    | Day      | Effect                                           |
|--------|----------------------|---------|----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Fast   | 400 feet             | 4 miles | 30 miles | −5 penalty to passive Wisdom (Perception) scores |
| Normal | 300 feet             | 3 miles | 18 miles | —                                                |
| Slow   | 200 feet             | 2 miles | 24 miles | Able to use stealth                              |

##### Difficult Terrain

The travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear dungeon corridors. But adventurers often face dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep mountains, and ice-covered ground—all considered difficult terrain.

You move at half speed in difficult terrain— moving 1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed—so you can cover only half the normal distance in a minute, an hour, or a day.

#### Special Types of Movement

Movement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness areas often involves more than simply walking. Adventurers might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get where they need to go.

##### Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling

While climbing or swimming, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing or swimming speed. At the GM’s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds requires a successful Strength (Physique) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful Strength (Physique) check.

##### Jumping

Your Strength determines how far you can jump.

**_Long Jump._** When you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet up to your Strength score if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement.

This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn’t matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM’s option, you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Physique) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump’s distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.

When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.


**_High Jump._** When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to 3 + your Strength modifier if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. In some circumstances, your GM might allow you to make a Strength (Physique) check to jump higher than you normally can.

\page

You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1½ times your height.

### The Environment

By its nature, adventuring involves delving into places that are dark, dangerous, and full of mysteries to be explored. The rules in this section cover some of the most important ways in which adventurers interact with the environment in such places.

#### Falling

A fall from a great height is one of the most common hazards facing an adventurer. At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. The creature lands prone, unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.

#### Suffocating

A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).

When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can’t regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.

For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points.

#### Vision and Light

The most fundamental tasks of adventuring— noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a tek skill, to name just a few—rely heavily on a character’s ability to see. Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.

A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a **lightly obscured** area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

A **heavily obscured** area—such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage—blocks vision entirely. A creature effectively suffers from the blinded condition (see appendix A) when trying to see something in that area.

The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.

**Bright light** lets most creatures see normally.

Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.

**Dim light**, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.

**Darkness** creates a heavily obscured area.

Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of tek darkness.

```
```

##### Blindsight

A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as oozes, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons, have this sense.

##### Darkvision

Many creatures in futuristic gaming worlds, especially those that dwell underground, have darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision can see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature is concerned. However, the creature can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

##### Truesight

A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and tek darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceives the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by tek. Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.

#### Food and Water

Characters who don’t eat or drink suffer the effects of exhaustion (see appendix A). Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can’t be removed until the character eats and drinks the full required amount.

##### Food

A character needs one pound of food per day and can make food last longer by subsisting on half rations. Eating half a pound of food in a day counts as half a day without food.

A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end of each day beyond that limit, a character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion.

A normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.

##### Water

A character needs one gallon of water per day, or two gallons per day if the weather is hot. A character who drinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion at the end of the day. A character with access to even less water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of the day.

If the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character takes two levels in either case.

\page
#### Interacting with Objects

A character’s interaction with objects in an environment is often simple to resolve in the game. The player tells the GM that his or her character is doing something, such as moving a lever, and the GM describes what, if anything, happens.


For example, a character might decide to pull a lever, which might, in turn, raise a portcullis, cause a room to flood with water, or open a secret door in a nearby wall. If the lever is rusted in position, though, a character might need to force it. In such a situation, the GM might call for a Strength check to see whether the character can wrench the lever into place. The GM sets the DC for any such check based on the difficulty of the task.

Characters can also damage objects with their weapons and tek skills. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage, but otherwise they can be affected by physical and tek attacks much like creatures can. The GM determines an object’s Armor Class and hit points, and might decide that certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks. (It’s hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects always fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and they are immune to effects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks.

A character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object. The GM sets the DC for any such check.

```
```

### Resting

Heroic though they might be, adventurers can’t spend every hour of the day in the thick of exploration, social interaction, and combat. They need rest—time to sleep and eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds and spirits for Tekcasting, and brace themselves for further adventure.

Adventurers can take short rests in the midst of an adventuring day and a long rest to end the day.

#### Short Rest

A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.

A character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to the character’s maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character’s level. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character’s Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total. The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. A character regains some spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest, as explained below.

#### Long Rest

A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps or performs light activity: reading, talking, eating, or standing watch for no more than 2 hours. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity—at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting tek skills, or similar adventuring activity—the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it.

At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal to half of the character’s total number of them (minimum of one die). For example, if a character has eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain four spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest.

A character can’t benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.

<!-- Downtime -->
\page
### Between Adventures

Between trips to dungeons and battles against ancient evils, adventurers need time to rest, recuperate, and prepare for their next adventure. Many adventurers also use this time to perform other tasks, such as crafting arms and armor, performing research, or spending their hard-earned gold.

In some cases, the passage of time is something that occurs with little fanfare or description. When starting a new adventure, the GM might simply declare that a certain amount of time has passed and allow you to describe in general terms what your character has been doing. At other times, the GM might want to keep track of just how much time is passing as events beyond your perception stay in motion.

#### Lifestyle Expenses

Between adventures, you choose a particular quality of life and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle.

Living a particular lifestyle doesn’t have a huge effect on your character, but your lifestyle can affect the way other individuals and groups react to you. For example, when you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier for you to influence the nobles of the city than if you live in poverty.

#### Downtime Activities

Between adventures, the GM might ask you what your character is doing during his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can vary in duration, but each downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.

Downtime activities other than the ones presented below are possible. If you want your character to spend his or her downtime performing an activity not covered here, discuss it with your GM.

##### Crafting

You can craft nontek objects, including adventuring equipment and works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the object you are trying to create (typically artisan’s tools). You might also need access to special materials or locations necessary to create it.

For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 500 credits, and you must expend raw materials worth half the total market value. If something you want to craft has a market value greater than 500 credits, you make progress every day in 500 credits increments until you reach the market value of the item. For example, a suit of plate armor (market value 150000 credits) takes 300 days to craft by yourself.

Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each character contributes 500 credits worth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a suit of plate armor in 100 days, at a total cost of 75000 credits.

While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 100 credits per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost.

##### Practicing a Profession

You can work between adventures, allowing you to maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 100 credits per day. This benefit lasts as long you continue to practice your profession.
If you are a member of an organization that can provide gainful employment, such as a temple or a thieves’ guild, you earn enough to support a comfortable lifestyle instead.
If you have proficiency in the Performance skill and put your performance skill to use during your downtime, you earn enough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead.

##### Recuperating

You can use downtime between adventures to recover from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison.

After three days of downtime spent recuperating, you can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, you can choose one of the following results:

* End one effect on you that prevents you from regaining hit points.
* For the next 24 hours, gain advantage on saving throws against one disease or poison currently affecting you.

##### Researching

The time between adventures is a great chance to perform research, gaining insight into mysteries that have unfurled over the course of the campaign.

For each day of research, you must spend 100 credits to cover your expenses. This cost is in addition to your normal lifestyle expenses.

##### Training

You can spend time between adventures learning a new language or training with a set of tools. Your GM might allow additional training options.

First, you must find an instructor willing to teach you. The GM determines how long it takes, and whether one or more ability checks are required.

The training lasts for 250 days and costs 100 credits per day. After you spend the requisite amount of time and money, you learn the new language or gain proficiency with the new tool.

<!-- Combat -->
\page
## The Order of Combat

---

A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and Tekcasting. The game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A
**round** represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a **turn**. The order of turns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated the other.

> #### Combat Step by Step
>
> 1.  **Determine surprise.** The GM determines whether anyone involved in the combat encounter is surprised.
> 2.  **Establish positions.** The GM decides where all the characters and monsters are located. Given the adventurers’ marching order or their stated positions in the room or other location, the GM figures out where the adversaries are̶how far away and in what direction.
> 3.  **Roll initiative.** Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls initiative, determining the order of combatants’ turns.
> 4.  **Take turns.** Each participant in the battle takes a turn in initiative order.
> 5.  **Begin the next round.** When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until the fighting stops.

#### Surprise

A band of adventurers Stealths up on a Space Pirate camp, springing from the trees to attack them. A gelatinous cube glides down a dungeon passage, unnoticed by the adventurers until the cube engulfs one of them. In these situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the other.

The GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the GM compares the Dexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn’t notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.

If you’re surprised, you can’t move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can’t take a reaction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren’t.

#### Initiative

Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every participant makes a Dexterity check to determine their place in the initiative order. The GM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same time.

The GM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with the lowest. This is the order (called the initiative order) in which they act during each round. The initiative order remains the same from round to round.

If a tie occurs, the GM decides the order among tied GM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the order among their tied characters. The GM can decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character. Optionally, the GM can have the tied characters and monsters each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest roll going first.

#### Your Turn

On your turn, you can **move** a distance up to your speed and **take one action**. You decide whether to move first or take your action first. Your speed— sometimes called your walking speed—is noted on your character sheet.

The most common actions you can take are described in the “Actions in Combat” section later in this chapter. Many class features and other abilities provide additional options for your action.

The “Movement and Position” section later in this chapter gives the rules for your move.

You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can’t decide what to do on your turn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, as described in “Actions in Combat.”

##### Bonus Actions

Various class features, tek skills, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action. The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows a scoundrel to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action only when a special ability, tek skill, or other feature of the game states that you can do something as a bonus action. You otherwise don’t have a bonus action to take.

You can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than one available.

You choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the bonus action’s timing is specified, and anything that deprives you of your ability to take actions also prevents you from taking a bonus action.

##### Other Activity on Your Turn

Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your action nor your move.

You can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.

You can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action. For example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.

If you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action. Some alien artifacts and other special objects always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.

The GM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the GM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.

\page

#### Reactions

Certain special abilities, tek skills, and situations allow you to take a special action called a reaction. A reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else’s. The opportunity attack, described later in this chapter, is the most common type of reaction.

When you take a reaction, you can’t take another one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature’s turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the reaction.

### Movement and Position

In combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain the upper hand.

On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as much or as little of your speed as you like on your turn, following the rules here.

Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can constitute your entire move. However you’re moving, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done moving.

#### Breaking Up Your Move

You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move 10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.

##### Moving between Attacks

If you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you can break up your movement even further by moving between those attacks. For example, a soldier who can make two attacks with the Extra Attack feature and who has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, make an attack, move 15 feet, and then attack again.

##### Using Different Speeds

If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you’ve already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can’t use the new speed during the current move.

For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60 because an arcanist cast the *fly* tek skill on you, you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, and then leap into the air to fly 30 feet more.

#### Difficult Terrain

Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains. Boulder-strewn caverns, briar* choked forests, treacherous staircases—the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.

Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.

Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.

#### Being Prone

Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they are prone, a condition described in appendix A.

You can **drop prone** without using any of your speed. **Standing up** takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend

15 feet of movement to stand up. You can’t stand up if you don’t have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.

To move while prone, you must **crawl** or use tek such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of movement.

### Interacting with Objects Around You

Here are a few examples of the sorts of thing you can do in tandem with your movement and action:

* draw or sheathe a weapon
* open or close a door
* withdraw a potion from your backpack
* pick up a dropped axe
* take a bauble from a table
* remove a ring from your finger
* stuff some food into your mouth
* plant a banner in the ground
* fish a few coins from your belt pouch
* drink all the ale in a flagon
* throw a lever or a switch
* pull a torch from a sconce

#### Moving Around Other Creatures

You can move through a nonhostile creature’s space. In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature’s space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature’s space is difficult terrain for you.

Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can’t willingly end your move in its space.

If you leave a hostile creature’s reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity attack, as explained later in the chapter.


\page

#### Flying Movement

Flying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but they must also deal with the danger of falling. If a flying creature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held aloft by tek, such as by the *fly* tek skill.


#### Null Gravity
While moving in null gravity you must make an Acrobatics ability check determine success. If you aren't careful you can miss, undershoot, or overshoot and go spinning in a random direction. When moving in null gravity you maintain momentum until you run into a solid object. In a large space you may use one turn to move your movement speed. You will continue to move your movement speed every subsequent turn until you run into something, or are able to propel yourself somehow. Grav Boots and Jet Packs are very useful in Null G.

#### Creature Size

Each creature takes up a different amount of space. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. Objects sometimes use the same size categories.

**Size Categories (table)**

| Size       | Space                  |
|------------|------------------------|
| Tiny       | 2½ by 2½ ft.           |
| Small      | 5 by 5 ft.             |
| Medium     | 5 by 5 ft.             |
| Large      | 10 by 10 ft.           |
| Huge       | 15 by 15 ft.           |
| Gargantuan | 20 by 20 ft. or larger |

##### Space

A creature’s space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium creature isn’t 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5* foot-wide doorway, other creatures can’t get through unless the hobgoblin lets them.

A creature’s space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there’s a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one.

Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If five Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there’s little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.

##### Squeezing into a Smaller Space

A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that’s only 5 feet wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it’s in the smaller space.

### Actions in Combat

When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your class or a special feature, or an action that you improvise. Many monsters have action options of their own in their stat blocks.

When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the GM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.

#### Attack

The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an bullet from a bow, or brawling with your fists.

With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the “Making an Attack” section for the rules that govern attacks.

Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the soldier, allow you to make more than one attack with this action.

#### Cast a Tek

Tekcasters such as Arcanists and priests, as well as many monsters, have access to tek skills and can use them to great effect in combat. Each tek skill has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the tek skill. Casting a tek skill is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most tek skills do have a casting time of 1 action, so a tekcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a tek skill.

#### Dash

When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you dash.

Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you dash.

#### Disengage

If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.

#### Dodge

When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated (as explained in appendix A) or if your speed drops to 0.

\page

#### Help

You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn.

Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally’s attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage.

#### Hide

When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the “Unseen Attackers and Targets” section later in this chapter.

#### Ready

Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn.

First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include “If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I’ll pull the lever that opens it,” and “If the goblin steps next to me, I move away.”

When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.

When you ready a tek skill, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a tek skill must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the tek skill’s tek requires concentration. If your concentration is broken, the tek skill dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the _web_ tek skill and ready _tek missile_, your _web_ tek skill ends, and if you take damage before you release _tek missile_ with your reaction, your concentration might be broken.

#### Search

When you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search, the GM might have you make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check.

#### Use an Object

You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When an object requires your action for its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn.

### Making an Attack

Whether you’re striking with a melee weapon, firing a weapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a tek skill, an attack has a simple structure.

1. **Choose a target.** Pick a target within your attack’s range: a creature, an object, or a location.
2. **Determine modifiers.** The GM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage against the target. In addition, tek skills, special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.
3. **Resolve the attack.** You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead of damage.

If there’s ever any question whether something you’re doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you’re making an attack roll, you’re making an attack.

#### Attack Rolls

When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target’s Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. The AC of a character is determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a monster is in its stat block.

##### Modifiers to the Roll

When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character’s proficiency bonus. When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat block.

**_Ability Modifier_** The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that have the finesse or thrown property break this rule.

Some tek skills also require an attack roll. The ability modifier used for a tek skill attack depends on the Tekcasting ability of the tekcaster.

**_Proficiency Bonus_** You add your proficiency bonus to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with which you have proficiency, as well as when you attack with a tek skill.

##### Rolling 1 or 20

Sometimes fate blesses or hacks a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.

If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC. This is called a critical hit, which is explained later in this chapter.

If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC.

#### Unseen Attackers and Targets

Combatants often try to escape their foes’ notice by hiding, casting the invisibility tek skill, or lurking in darkness.

When you attack a target that you can’t see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether you’re guessing the target’s location or you’re targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn’t in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the GM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the target’s location correctly.

\page

When a creature can’t see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it. If you are hidden—both unseen and unheard—when you make an attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.

#### Ranged Attacks

When you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a crossbow, hurl a handaxe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe at a distance. A monster might shoot spines from its tail. Many tek skills also involve making a ranged attack.

##### Range

You can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range.

If a ranged attack, such as one made with a tek skill, has a single range, you can’t attack a target beyond this range.

Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a railrifle or a scorcher, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your target is beyond normal range, and you can’t attack a target beyond the long range.

##### Ranged Attacks in Close Combat

Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a tek skill, or some other means, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see you and who isn’t incapacitated.

#### Melee Attacks

Used in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon such as a sword, an ion slingblade, or an axe. A typical monster makes a melee attack when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other body part. A few tek skills also involve making a melee attack.

Most creatures have a 5-foot **reach** and can thus attack targets within 5 feet of them when making a melee attack. Certain creatures (typically those larger than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.

Instead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use an **unarmed strike**: a punch, kick, head-butt, or similar forceful blow (none of which count as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + your Strength modifier. You are proficient with your unarmed strikes.

##### Opportunity Attacks

In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance to strike an enemy who is fleeing or passing by. Such a strike is called an opportunity attack.

You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach.

You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the Disengage action. You also don’t provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport or when someone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction. For example, you don’t provoke an opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe’s reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.

##### Two-Weapon Fighting

When you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon that you’re holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different light melee weapon that you’re holding in the other hand. You don’t add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.

If either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it.

##### Grappling

When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.

The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check instead of an attack roll: a Strength (Physique) check contested by the target’s Strength (Physique) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled condition (see appendix A). The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).

**_Escaping a Grapple_** A grappled creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Physique) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your Strength
(Physique) check.

**_Moving a Grappled Creature_** When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.

> #### Contests in Combat
>
> Battle often involves pitting your prowess against that of your foe. Such a challenge is represented by a contest. This section includes the most common contests that require an action in combat: grappling and shoving a creature. The GM can use these contests as models for improvising others.

##### Shoving a Creature

Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or push it away from you. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.

\page

The target must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Instead of making an attack roll, you make a Strength (Physique) check contested by the target’s Strength (Physique) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you win the contest, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from you.

### Cover

Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.

There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren’t added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.

A target with **half cover** has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a nbullet tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.

A target with **three-quarters cover** has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an bullet slit, or a thick tree trunk.

A target with **total cover** can’t be targeted directly by an attack or a tek skill, although some tek skills can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.

### Damage and Healing

Injury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who explore futuristic gaming worlds. The thrust of a sword, a well-placed bullet, or a blast of flame from a *fireball* tek skill all have the potential to damage, or even kill, the hardiest of creatures.

#### Hit Points

Hit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more fragile.

A creature’s current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be any number from the creature’s hit point maximum down to 0. This number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing.

Whenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature’s capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points.

#### Damage Rolls

Each weapon, tek skill, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to your target. Tek weapons, special abilities, and other factors can grant a bonus to damage. With a penalty, it is possible to deal 0 damage, but never negative damage.

When attacking with a **weapon**, you add your ability modifier—the same modifier used for the attack roll—to the damage. A **tek skill** tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers.

If a tek skill or other effect deals damage to **more than one target** at the same time, roll the damage once for all of them. For example, when an arcanist casts _fireball_ or a priest casts _flame strike_, the tek skill’s damage is rolled once for all creatures caught in the blast.

##### Critical Hits

When you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the attack’s damage against the target. Roll all of the attack’s damage dice twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, you can roll all the damage dice at once.

For example, if you score a critical hit with an ion dagger, roll 2d4 for the damage, rather than 1d4, and then add your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the scoundrel’s Stealth Attack feature, you roll those dice twice as well.

##### Damage Types

Different attacks, damaging tek skills, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.

The damage types follow, with examples to help a GM assign a damage type to a new effect.

**_Acid_** The corrosive spray of a black dragon’s breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage.

**_Bludgeoning_** Blunt force attacks—hammers, falling, constriction, and the like—deal bludgeoning damage.

**_Cold_** The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil’s Pulse Dagger and the frigid blast of a white dragon’s breath deal cold damage.

**_Fire_** Red dragons breathe fire, and many tek skills conjure flames to deal fire damage.

**_Force_** Force is pure tek energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are tek skills, including _tek missile_ and _spiritual weapon_.

**_Shock_** A _lightning bolt_ tek skill and a blue dragon’s breath deal lightning damage.

**_Radiation_** Radiation damage, dealt by certain undead and a tek skill such as _chill touch_, withers matter and even the soul.

**_Piercing_** Puncturing and impaling attacks, including Pulse Daggers and monsters’ bites, deal piercing damage.

**_Poison_** Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green dragon’s breath deal poison damage.

**_Psychic_** Mental abilities such as a mind flayer’s psionic blast deal psychic damage.

**_Radiant_** Radiant damage, dealt by a priest’s _flame strike_ tek skill or an angel’s smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.

**_Slashing_** Swords, axes, and monsters’ claws deal slashing damage.

**_Concussive_** A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the _shockwave_ tek skill, deals concussive damage.

\page

#### Damage Resistance and Vulnerability

Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.

If a creature or an object has **resistance** to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has **vulnerability** to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.

Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a tek aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.

Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all nontek damage, the damage of a nontek fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three* quarters.

#### Healing

Unless it results in death, damage isn’t permanent. Even death is reversible through powerful tek. Rest can restore a creature’s hit points, and tek methods such as a _cure wounds_ tek skill or a _potion of healing_ can remove damage in an instant.

When a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature’s hit points can’t exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a morph grants a scout 8 hit points of healing. If the scout has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the scout regains 6 hit points from the morph, not 8.

A creature that has died can’t regain hit points until tek such as the _revivify_ tek skill has restored it to life.

#### Dropping to 0 Hit Points

When you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections.

##### Instant Death

Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.

For example, a priest with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the priest dies.

##### Falling Unconscious

If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall unconscious (see appendix A). This unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.

##### Death Saving Throws

Whenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn’t tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by tek skills and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw.

Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable.

**_Rolling 1 or 20_** When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.

**_Damage at 0 Hit Points_** If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.

##### Stabilizing a Creature

The best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that it isn’t killed by a failed death saving throw.

You can use your action to administer first aid to an unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.

A **stable** creature doesn’t make death saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious. The creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn’t healed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.

##### Monsters and Death

Most GMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it fall unconscious and make death saving throws.

Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the GM might have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as player characters.

#### Knocking a Creature Out

Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls unconscious and is stable.

#### Temporary Hit Points

Some tek skills and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a creature. Temporary hit points aren’t actual hit points; they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from injury.

When you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage.

\page

Because temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character can, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.

Healing can’t restore temporary hit points, and they can’t be added together. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a tek skill grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.

If you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn’t restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. They can still absorb damage directed at you while you’re in that state, but only true healing can save you.

Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, they last until they’re depleted or you finish a long rest.

### Mounted Combat

A Lancer charging into battle on a warhorse, an arcanist casting tek skills from the back of a griffon, or a priest soaring through the sky on a pegasus all enjoy the benefits of speed and mobility that a mount can provide.

A willing creature that is at least one size larger than you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount, using the following rules.

#### Mounting and Dismounting

Once during your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to mount a horse. Therefore, you can’t mount it if you don’t have 15 feet of movement left or if your speed is 0.

If an effect moves your mount against its will while you’re on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off the mount, landing prone in a space within 5 feet of it. If you’re knocked prone while mounted, you must make the same saving throw.

If your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall prone in a space within 5 feet it.

#### Controlling a Mount

You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assumed to have such training. The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has only three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it.

An independent mount retains its place in the initiative order. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the actions the mount can take, and it moves and acts as it wishes. It might flee from combat, rush to attack and devour a badly injured foe, or otherwise act against your wishes.

In either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity attack while you’re on it, the attacker can target you or the mount.

### Mechanical Mounts
Mechanical mounts move on your turn, and some have certain restrictions for what actions you can take.

### Underwater Combat

When adventurers pursue sahuagin back to their undersea homes, fight off sharks in an ancient shipwreck, or find themselves in a flooded dungeon room, they must fight in a challenging environment. Underwater the following rules apply.

When making a **melee weapon attack**, a creature that doesn’t have a swimming speed (either natural or granted by tek) has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon is an ion dagger, javelin, ion blade, Pulse Dagger, or trident.

A **ranged weapon attack** automatically misses a target beyond the weapon’s normal range. Even against a target within normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a Pulse Dagger, trident, or dart).

Creatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have resistance to fire damage.

<!-- Vehicles -->

## Squad Combat

Whether you employ a squad of mercenaries, or your family/corporation have marine retainers in their service, having a squad of marines at your back is essential for many types of incursions. A group of marines can be broken up into any number of squads, but each squad will only take orders from 1 PC leader.

Mercenaries are expendable soldiers that can make or break any combat engagement. Many mercenaries have stack insurance ensuring that if they are killed in battle, they will receive a new sleeve. Real death is rare among mercenaries, and most will avoid aiming for the stack of a fellow mercenary as honor demands.

### Mercenary Salary
A single mercenary can be employed for 100 credits per day. A mercenary squad of 10 marines can be conscripted for 600 credits per day for a minimum of 1 week, or 1000 credits per day otherwise.

### Combat Mechanics

Mercenary squads roll initiative as a group with no initiative bonus. If a mercenary takes damage they must make a damage saving throw:

1-5: Instantly Dead.

6-10: Gravely injured. The mercenary is unconscious and must be stabilized before the end of combat.

11-15: Slightly injured. The mercenary can continue the fight, but must retreat at the end of the encounter.

16-20: Flesh wound. The mercenary can continue fighting.

Cover: If hit while behind cover, mercenaries gain +5 to damage saving throws.

Saving Throws: If an attack requires a saving throw, the mercenary gets +2 to the roll.

#### Marine

Armor Class: 11

Speed: 30

Attack: Rail Rifle. +2 to hit, 1d8 piercing damage.

### Marauder

Armor Class: 10

Speed: 35

## Conditions

---

Conditions alter a creature’s capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a tek skill, a class feature, a monster’s attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous.

A condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.

If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition’s effects don’t get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn’t.

The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a condition.

### Blinded
* A blinded creature can’t see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.
* Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage.

### Charmed
* A charmed creature can’t attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or tek effects.
* The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.

### Deafened
* A deafened creature can’t hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing.

### Exhaustion

Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect’s description.

| Level | Effect                                         |
|-------|------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Disadvantage on ability checks                 |
| 2     | Speed halved                                   |
| 3     | Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws |
| 4     | Hit point maximum halved                       |
| 5     | Speed reduced to 0                             |
| 6     | Death                                          |

If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect’s description.

A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.

An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect’s description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature’s exhaustion level is reduced below 1.

Finishing a long rest reduces a creature’s exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.

### Frightened
* A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.
* The creature can’t willingly move closer to the source of its fear.

### Grappled
* A grappled creature’s speed becomes 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed.
* The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated (see the condition).
* The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the *concussive-wave* tek skill.

### Incapacitated
* An incapacitated creature can’t take actions or reactions.

### Invisible
* An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of tek or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature’s location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.
* Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have advantage.

### Paralyzed
* A paralyzed creature is incapacitated (see the condition) and can’t move or speak.
* The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
* Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
* Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.

### Petrified
* A petrified creature is transformed, along with any nontek object it is wearing or carrying, into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone). Its weight increases by a factor of ten, and it ceases aging.
* The creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can’t move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.
* Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
* The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
* The creature has resistance to all damage.
* The creature is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized.

### Poisoned
* A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

\page

### Prone
* A prone creature’s only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.
* The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.
* An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.

### Restrained
* A restrained creature’s speed becomes 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed.
* Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage.
* The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.

### Stunned
* A stunned creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can’t move, and can speak only falteringly.
* The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
* Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.

### Unconscious
* An unconscious creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can’t move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings
* The creature drops whatever it’s holding and falls prone.
* The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
* Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
* Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.
