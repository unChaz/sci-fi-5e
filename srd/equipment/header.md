Currency is mostly dealt with in digital credits, however coins are still in circulation.

With one 100 credits, a character can buy a bedroll, 50 carbon fiber rope, or a low end datapad. A skilled (but not exceptional) worker can earn 100 credits a day.

50 credits buys a laborer's work for half a day, a night in a low end hostel, or a few rounds of drinks at a pub.

A single credit buys a pack of gum, small flashlight, or a bottle of water.

Coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.

**Standard Exchange Rates (table)**

| Coin          | Credits |

| Copper (cp)   | 1     |
| Silver (sp)   | 10    |
| Gold (gp)     | 100   |
| Platinum (pp) | 1,000 |

### Selling Loot

Opportunities abound to find loot, equipment, weapons, armor, and more in the dungeons you explore. Normally, you can sell your loot and trinkets when you return to a town or other colony, provided that you can find buyers and merchants interested in your loot.

**_Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment._** As a general rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch half their cost when sold in a market. Weapons and armor used by raiders are rarely in good enough condition to sell.

**_Alien Artifacts._** Selling alien artifacts is problematic. Finding someone to buy a potion or a datacube isn't too hard, but other items are out of the realm of most but the wealthiest nobles. Likewise, aside from a few common alien artifacts, you won't normally come across alien artifacts or tek skills to purchase. The value of tek is far beyond simple gold and should always be treated as such.

**_Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects._** These items retain their full value in the marketplace, and you can either trade them in for coin or use them as currency for other transactions. For exceptionally valuable loot, the GM might require you to find a buyer in a large town or larger community first.

**_Trade Goods._** In the black abyss, many people conduct transactions through barter. Like gems and art objects, trade rare minerals, water, livestock, and so onâ€”retain their full value in the market and can be used as currency.
