## Squad Combat

Whether you employ a squad of mercenaries, or your family/corporation have marine retainers in their service, having a squad of marines at your back is essential for many types of incursions. A group of marines can be broken up into any number of squads, but each squad will only take orders from 1 PC leader.

Mercenaries are expendable soldiers that can make or break any combat engagement. Many mercenaries have stack insurance ensuring that if they are killed in battle, they will receive a new sleeve. Real death is rare among mercenaries, and most will avoid aiming for the stack of a fellow mercenary as honor demands.

### Mercenary Salary
A single mercenary can be employed for 100 credits per day. A mercenary squad of 10 marines can be conscripted for 600 credits per day for a minimum of 1 week, or 1000 credits per day otherwise.

### Combat Mechanics

Mercenary squads roll initiative as a group with no initiative bonus. If a mercenary takes damage they must make a damage saving throw:

1-5: Instantly Dead.

6-10: Gravely injured. The mercenary is unconscious and must be stabilized within 1 minute of going unconscious.

11-15: Slightly injured. The mercenary can continue the fight, but must retreat at the end of the encounter until a full rest.

16+: Flesh wound. The mercenary can continue fighting.

Cover: If hit while behind cover, mercenaries gain +5 to damage saving throws.

Saving Throws: If an attack requires a saving throw, the base modifier the mercenary gets is +2.

#### Marine

Armor Class: 11

Speed: 30

Attack: Rail Rifle. +2 to hit, 1d8 piercing damage.

### Marauder

Armor Class: 10

Speed: 35

Attack: Pulse Axe. +2 to hit, 1d10 slashing damage.

#### Leadership Inspiration

With the Inspiring Leader feat, your squad of marines gain +2 to initiative rolls, and +2 to Armor Class. This bonus only applies to marines directly under your command.
