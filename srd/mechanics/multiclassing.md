### Multiclassing

Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options.

With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining a level in your current class. Your levels in all your classes are added together to determine your character level. For example, if you have three levels in Arcanist and two in soldier, you're a 5th-level character.

As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of your original class with just a few levels in another class, or you might change course entirely, never looking back at the class you left behind. You might even start progressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to a single-class character of the same level, you'll sacrifice some focus in exchange for versatility.

#### Prerequisites

To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your new one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For example, a brute who decides to multiclass into the morph class must have both Strength and Wisdom scores of 13 or higher. Without the full training that a beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in your new class, having a natural aptitude that is reflected by higher- than-average ability scores.

**Multiclassing Prerequisites (table)**

| Class     | Ability Score Minimum       |
|-----------|-----------------------------|
| Brute | Strength 3                 |
| Evangelist      | Charisma 3                 |
| Priest    | Wisdom 3                   |
| Morph     | Wisdom 3                   |
| Soldier   | Strength 3 or Dexterity 3 |
| Monk      | Dexterity 3 and Wisdom 3  |
| Guardian   | Strength 3 and Charisma 3 |
| Scout    | Dexterity 3 and Wisdom 3  |
| Scoundrel     | Dexterity 3                |
| Scion  | Charisma 3                 |
| Cybernetic   | Charisma 3                 |
| Arcanist    | Intelligence 3             |

#### Experience Points

The experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table, not your level in a particular class. So, if you are a priest 6/soldier 1, you must gain enough XP to reach 8th level before you can take your second level as a soldier or your seventh level as a priest.

#### Hit Points and Hit Dice

You gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a class only when you are a 1st-level character.

You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can simply pool them together. For example, both the soldier and the guardian have a d10, so if you are a guardian 5/soldier 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them separately. If you are a guardian 5/priest 5, for example, you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d8 Hit Dice.

### Proficiency Bonus

Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table in chapter 1, not your level in a particular class. For example, if you are a soldier 3/scoundrel 2, you have the proficiency bonus of a 5th- level character, which is +3.

### Proficiencies

When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of new class's starting proficiencies, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.

| Arcanist    | —                                                                                                          |

#### Class Features

When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don't, however, receive the class's starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Tekcasting.

\page

##### Channel Divinity

If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn't give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a priest 6/guardian 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the priest class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.

##### Extra Attack

If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the soldier's version of Extra Attack does). Similarly, the cybernetic's nanotech invocation Thirsting Blade doesn't give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.

##### Unarmored Defense

If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can't gain it again from another class.

##### Tekcasting

Your capacity for Tekcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your Tekcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Tekcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Tekcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

**_Tek Skills Known and Prepared._** You determine what tek skills you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a scout 4/Arcanist 3, for example, you know three 1st-level scout tek skills based on your levels in the scout class. As 3rd-level Arcanist, you know three Arcanist cantrips, and your tek skill datapad contains ten Arcanist tek skills, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as an arcanist) can be 2nd-level tek skills. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six Arcanist tek skills from your tek skill datapad.

Each tek skill you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the Tekcasting ability of that class when you cast the tek skill. Similarly, a Tekcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the tek skills from the class associated with that focus.

**_Tek Slots._** You determine your available tek skill slots by adding together all your levels in the evangelist, priest, morph, scion, and Arcanist classes, and half your levels (rounded down) in the guardian and scout classes. Use this total to determine your tek skill slots by consulting the Multiclass Tekcaster table.

If you have more than one Tekcasting class, this table might give you tek skill slots of a level that is higher than the tek skills you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level tek skills. If a lower-level tek skill that you cast, like _burning hands_, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any tek skills of that higher level.

For example, if you are the aforementioned scout 4/Arcanist 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your tek skill slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don't know any 3rd-level tek skills, nor do you know any 2nd-level scout tek skills. You can use the tek skill slots of those levels to cast the tek skills you do know—and potentially enhance their effects.

**_Link Tek._** If you have both the Tekcasting class feature and the Link Tek class feature from the cybernetic class, you can use the tek skill slots you gain from the Link Tek feature to cast tek skills you know or have prepared from classes with the Tekcasting class feature, and you can use the tek skill slots you gain from the Tekcasting class feature to cast cybernetic tek skills you know.
