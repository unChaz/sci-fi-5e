#### Alignment

A typical creature in the game world has an alignment, which broadly describes its moral and personal attitudes. Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations.

These brief summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment. Individuals might vary significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment.

**Lawful good** (LG) creatures can be counted on to do the right thing as expected by society.

**Neutral good** (NG) folk do the best they can to help others according to their needs.

**Chaotic good** (CG) creatures act as their conscience directs, with little regard for what others expect.

**Lawful neutral** (LN) individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes.

**Neutral** (N) is the alignment of those who prefer to steer clear of moral questions and don’t take sides, doing what seems best at the time.

**Chaotic neutral** (CN) creatures follow their whims, holding their personal freedom above all else.

**Lawful evil** (LE) creatures methodically take what they want, within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order.

**Neutral evil** (NE) is the alignment of those who do whatever they can get away with, without compassion or qualms.

**Chaotic evil** (CE) creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust.

##### Alignment in the Multiverse

For many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral choice. Anyone can choose whether to follow the paths of good or evil, law or chaos.

Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought do not have alignments—they are **unaligned**. Such a creature is incapable of making a moral or ethical choice and acts according to its bestial nature. Sharks are savage predators, for example, but they are not evil; they have no alignment.

#### Languages

Your origin indicates the languages your character can speak by default, and your background might give you access to one or more additional languages of your choice. Note these languages on your character sheet.

Choose your languages from the Standard Languages table, or choose one that is common in your campaign. With your GM’s permission, you can instead choose a language from the Exotic Languages table or a secret language, such as thieves’ cant or the tongue of druids.

Some of these languages are actually families of languages with many dialects.

**Standard Languages (table)**

| Language | Typical Speakers | Script   |

| English  | Most Humans      | English   |

| Chinese  | Martians         | Chinese   |
| Russian  | Rim Dwellers     | Russian |
| Binary   | Robots           | Binary |

### Inspiration

Inspiration is a rule the game master can use to reward you for playing your character in a way that’s true to his or her personality traits, ideal, bond, and flaw. By using inspiration, you can draw on your personality trait of compassion for the downtrodden to give you an edge in negotiating with the Beggar Prince. Or inspiration can let you call on your bond to the defense of your home village to push past the effect of a tek skill that has been laid on you.

#### Gaining Inspiration

Your GM can choose to give you inspiration for a variety of reasons. Typically, GMs award it when you play out your personality traits, give in to the drawbacks presented by a flaw or bond, and otherwise portray your character in a compelling way. Your GM will tell you how you can earn inspiration in the game.

You either have inspiration or you don’t - you can’t stockpile multiple “inspirations” for later use.

#### Using Inspiration

If you have inspiration, you can expend it when you make an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. Spending your inspiration gives you advantage on that roll.

Additionally, if you have inspiration, you can reward another player for good roleplaying, clever thinking, or simply doing something exciting in the game. When another player character does something that really contributes to the story in a fun and interesting way, you can give up your inspiration to give that character inspiration.
