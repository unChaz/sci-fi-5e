## Races

---

As humanity spread out throughout the solar system, they began to adapt and change to their new environment. Many unique subraces of human resulted. Halfbreed

#### Racial Traits

The description of each race includes racial traits that are common to members of that race. The following entries appear among the traits of most races.

##### Ability Score Increase

Every race increases one or more of a character’s ability scores.

##### Age

All human races reach adulthood in their late teens and live just over a century. If you are not in your original sleeve, you can determine how old your stack is. Stacks were invented about a thousand years ago, so there is the potential for your character to be very old. However it is a privelege of the wealthy to be able to afford a new sleeve every time their sleeve dies. Synthetic sleeves require regular maintenance, but usually last about 50 years without major upgrades or replacements.

##### Alignment

Most races have tendencies toward certain alignments, described in this entry.

##### Size

Characters of most races are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few races are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding heavy weapons, as explained in “Equipment.”

##### Speed

Your speed determines how far you can move when traveling (“Adventuring”) and fighting (“Combat”).

##### Languages

By virtue of your race, your character can speak, read, and write certain languages.
