## Bionic

Some humans go the way of bionic enhancement. That is installing computer hardware to enhance their sleeve. You can't be born Bionic, only made that way.

### Sleeve Traits

**_Ability Score Increase._** Two ability scores increase by 1. One must come from your base race.

**_Size._** Bionics don't differ much from Earthborn and range between 5 and 6 feet. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

**_Speed._** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

#### Upgrades
Your sleeve has been upgraded, and although you look the same, subtle enhancements have been made. Choose one:

- Darkvision: Your eyes have been replaced with bionic eyes. You have 60 feet of darkvision.
- Digital Interface: You can interface directly with computers through connectors on your head. Interacting with computers takes a bonus action instead of an action.
- Titanium Arm: You arm has been replaced with a mechanical arm. It appears and feels like a normal arm, but it is resistant to being damaged, and you gain +2 to Strength checks when using that arm.
- Integrated Tekcaster: A tekcaster has been integrated into your hand. A hidden compartment in your wrist holds the gemstones. It is not noticable to the naked eye.

#### Sleeve Origin
Bionic sleeves were all born, or cloned. You must decide a base race, and inherit that ability score increase, and overall appearance.
