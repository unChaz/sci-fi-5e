#### Favored Enemy

Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy.

Choose a type of favored enemy: aliens, aberrations, beasts, celestials, robots, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two factions of humans as favored enemies.

You have advantage on Wisdom (Nature) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.

When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.

You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures.

#### Natural Explorer

You are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you’re proficient in.

While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits:
* Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel.
* Your group can’t become lost except by tek means.
* Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.
* If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.
* When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.
* While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.

You choose additional favored terrain types at 6th and 10th level.

#### Fighting Style

At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

##### Sharpshooter

You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

##### Defense

While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

##### Dueling

When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

##### Two-Weapon Fighting

When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

#### Tekcasting

By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the tek essence of nature to cast tek skills, much as a druid does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of Tekcasting and chapter 11 for the ranger tek skill list.

##### Tek Slots

The Ranger table shows how many tek skill slots you have to cast your tek skills of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these tek skills, you must expend a slot of the tek skill’s level or higher. You regain all expended tek skill slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level tek skill *animal friendship* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level tek skill slot available, you can cast *animal friendship* using either slot.

##### Tek Skills Known of 1st Level and Higher

You know two 1st-level tek skills of your choice from the ranger tek skill list.

The Tek Skills Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger tek skills of your choice. Each of these tek skills must be of a level for which you have tek skill slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new tek skill of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger tek skills you know and replace it with another tek skill from the ranger tek skill list, which also must be of a level for which you have tek skill slots.

##### Tekcasting Ability

Wisdom + Will is your Tekcasting ability for your ranger tek skills, since your tek draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a tek skill refers to your Tekcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger tek skill you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Tek save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier + your Will modifier

**Tek attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier + your Will modifier

#### Ranger Archetype

At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate: Hunter or Beast Master, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.

#### Primeval Awareness

Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger tek skill slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the tek skill slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature doesn’t reveal the creatures’ location or number.

#### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

#### Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

#### Land’s Stride

Starting at 8th level, moving through nontek difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nontek plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the *entangle* tek skill.

#### Hide in Plain Sight

Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage.

Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.

#### Vanish

Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can’t be tracked by nontek means, unless you choose to leave a trail.

#### Feral Senses

At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can’t see. When you attack a creature you can’t see, your inability to see it doesn’t impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.

You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn’t hidden from you and you aren’t blinded or deafened.

#### Foe Slayer

At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.

#### Ranger Archetypes

The ideal of the ranger has two classic expressions: the Hunter and the Beast Master.

##### Hunter

Emulating the Hunter archetype means accepting your place as a bulwark between civilization and the terrors of the wilderness. As you walk the Hunter’s path, you learn specialized techniques for fighting the threats you face, from rampaging ogres and hordes of orcs to towering giants and terrifying dragons.

###### Hunter’s Prey

At 3rd level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

**_Colossus Slayer._** Your tenacity can wear down the most potent foes. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage if it’s below its hit point maximum. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn.

**_Giant Killer._** When a Large or larger creature within 5 feet of you hits or misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to attack that creature immediately after its attack, provided that you can see the creature.

**_Horde Breaker._** Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target and within range of your weapon.

###### Defensive Tactics

At 7th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

**_Escape the Horde._** Opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage.

**_Multiattack Defense._** When a creature hits you with an attack, you gain a +4 bonus to AC against all subsequent attacks made by that creature for the rest of the turn.

**_Steel Will._** You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.

###### Multiattack

At 11th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

**_Volley._** You can use your action to make a ranged attack against any number of creatures within 10 feet of a point you can see within your weapon’s range. You must have ammunition for each target, as normal, and you make a separate attack roll for each target.

**_Whirlwind Attack._** You can use your action to make a melee attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each target.

###### Superior Hunter’s Defense

At 15th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

**_Evasion._** When you are subjected to an effect, such as a red dragon’s fiery breath or a *lightning bolt* tek skill, that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

**_Stand Against the Tide._** When a hostile creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to repeat the same attack against another creature (other than itself) of your choice.

**_Uncanny Dodge._** When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you.
