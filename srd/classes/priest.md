##### Hit Points

**Hit Dice:** 1d8 per priest level

**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution Modifier + Will modifier

**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution Modifier + Will modifier per priest level after 1st

##### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

* (*a*) a scorcher or (*b*) an ion slingblade (if proficient)
* (*a*) kevlar, (*b*) Flak armor, or (*c*) scarab skin (if proficient)
* (*a*) a scorcher and 20 clips of ammunition or (*b*) any simple weapon
* (*a*) a chaplin's pack or (*b*) a field survival kit
* A medkit and a religious symbol


#### Tekcasting

As a conduit for Alien power, you can cast priest tek skills.
```
```


##### Cantrips

At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the priest tek skill list. You learn additional priest cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Priest table.

##### Preparing and Casting Tek Skills

The Priest table shows how many tek skill slots you have to cast your tek skills of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these tek skills, you must expend a slot of the tek skill’s level or higher. You regain all expended tek skill slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of priest tek skills that are available for you to cast, choosing from the priest tek skill list. When you do so, choose a number of priest tek skills equal to your Wisdom modifier + your priest level (minimum of one tek skill). The tek skills must be of a level for which you have tek skill slots.

For example, if you are a 3rd-level priest, you have four
1st-level and two 2nd-level tek skill slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared tek skills can include six tek skills of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level tek skill *cure wounds*, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the tek skill doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared tek skills.

You can change your list of prepared tek skills when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of priest tek skills requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per tek skill level for each tek skill on your list.

##### Tekcasting Ability

Wisdom + Will is your Tekcasting ability for your priest tek skills. The power of your tek skills comes from your devotion to your sect. You use your Wisdom whenever a priest tek skill refers to your Tekcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a priest tek skill you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Tek save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier + your Will modifier

**Tek attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier + your Will modifier

##### Ritual Casting

You can cast a priest tek skill as a ritual if that tek skill has the ritual tag and you have the tek skill prepared.

#### Tekcasting Focus

You can use a holy symbol (see chapter 5, “Equipment”) as a Tekcasting focus for your priest tek skills.

#### Alien Domain

Choose one domain related to your sect: Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. Each domain is detailed at the end of the class description, and each one provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you domain tek skills and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.

##### Domain Tek Skills

Each domain has a list of tek skills—its domain tek skills— that you gain at the priest levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain tek skill, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of tek skills you can prepare each day.

If you have a domain tek skill that doesn’t appear on the priest tek skill list, the tek skill is nonetheless a priest tek skill for you.

#### Channel Divinity

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel Alien energy directly from your sect, using that energy to fuel tek effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.

When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.

Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your priest tek skill save DC.

Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel

Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.
```
```


##### Channel Divinity: Turn Undead

As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

#### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

#### Destroy Undead

Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table.
\page


**Destroy Undead (table)**

| Priest Level | Destroys Undead of CR... |
|--------------|--------------------------|
| 5th          | 1/2 or lower             |
| 8th          | 1 or lower               |
| 11th         | 2 or lower               |
| 14th         | 3 or lower               |
| 17th         | 4 or lower               |

#### Alien Intervention

Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your sect to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.

Imploring your sect’s aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your priest level, your sect intervenes. The GM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any priest tek skill or priest domain tek skill would be appropriate.

If your sect intervenes, you can’t use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.

At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.

#### Priest Domains

##### Life Domain

The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy—one of the fundamental forces of the universe—that sustains all life. The gods of life promote vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of death and undeath. Almost any non-evil sect can claim influence over this domain, particularly agricultural sects (such as Chauntea, Arawai, and Demeter), sun gods (such as Lathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods of healing or endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and Diancecht), and gods of home and community (such as Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrei).

**Life Domain Tek Skills (table)**

| Priest Level | Tek Skills                               |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| 1st          | bless, cure wounds                   |
| 3rd          | lesser restoration, spiritual weapon |
| 5th          | beacon of hope, revivify             |
| 7th          | death ward, guardian of faith        |
| 9th          | mass cure wounds, raise dead         |

###### Bonus Proficiency

When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor.

###### Disciple of Life

Also starting at 1st level, your healing tek skills are more effective. Whenever you use a tek skill of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the tek skill’s level.

###### Channel Divinity: Preserve Life

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to heal the badly injured.

As an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your priest level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can’t use this feature on an undead or a construct.

###### Blessed Healer

Beginning at 6th level, the healing tek skills you cast on others heal you as well. When you cast a tek skill of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the tek skill’s level.

###### Alien Strike

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with Alien energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

###### Supreme Healing

Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a tek skill, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12.
