#### Bionic Enhancements

At 1st level, to allow you to to seamlessly interface with computers, you have been upgraded with bionic enhancements. Your sleeve must be synthetic, bionic, or you have paid to have custom bionic enhancements installed.

#### AI Patron

At 1st level, through your bionic enhancements, you have bonded with an ancient alien AI called a "muse". Your muse makes it easy for you to interface with nearby networks and computers, and usually comes with a quirky personality.

#### Muse Tek

Your arcane research and the tek bestowed on you by your muse have given you facility with tek skills.

##### Cantrips

You know two cantrips of your choice from the cybernetic tek skill list. You learn additional cybernetic cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cybernetic table.

##### Tek Slots

The Cybernetic table shows how many tek skill slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your tek skill slots are the same level. To cast one of your cybernetic tek skills of 1st level or higher, you must expend a tek skill slot. You regain all expended tek skill slots when you finish a short or long rest.

For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level tek skill slots. To cast the 1st-level tek skill *shockwave*, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level tek skill.

##### Tek Skills Known of 1st Level and Higher

At 1st level, you know two 1st-level tek skills of your choice from the cybernetic tek skill list.

The Tek Skills Known column of the Cybernetic table shows when you learn more cybernetic tek skills of your choice of 1st level and higher. A tek skill you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new cybernetic tek skill, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the cybernetic tek skills you know and replace it with another tek skill from the cybernetic tek skill list, which also must be of a level for which you have tek skill slots.

##### Tekcasting Ability

Charisma + Will is your Tekcasting ability for your cybernetic tek skills, so you use your Charisma whenever a tek skill refers to your Tekcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cybernetic tek skill you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Tek save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier + your Will modifier

**Tek attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier + your Will modifier + your Wit modifier

##### Tekcasting Focus

You can use an tekcaster as a Tekcasting focus for your cybernetic tek skills.

#### Nanotech Modules

Your muse provides you with access to alien nanotech that imbue you with an abiding tek ability.

At 2nd level, you gain two nanotech modules of your choice. Your module options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain cybernetic levels, you gain additional modules of your choice, as shown in the Modules Known column of the Cybernetic table.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the modules you know and replace it with another module that you could learn at that level.

#### Muse

At 3rd level, your muse gives you one of the following features of your choice.

##### Link of the Drone

You learn the *find familiar* tek skill and can cast it as a ritual. The tek skill doesn’t count against your number of tek skills known.

When you cast the tek skill, the form of your familiar is a recon drone with a fly speed of 60, 13 AC, 7 HP, Perception +3, Stealth +4, 60ft of darkvision, 10ft of blindsight.

The familiar is controlled by your muse, and you gain all normal benefits of a familiar.

Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its reaction.

##### Link of the Blade

You can use your action to create a nanotech weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as tek for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nontek attacks and damage.

Your nanotech weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.

You can transform one tek weapon into your nanotech weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your nanotech weapon thereafter. You can’t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your nanotech weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.

##### Link of the Tome

Your muse gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class’s tek skill list (the three needn’t be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don’t count against your number of cantrips known. If they don’t appear on the cybernetic tek skill list, they are nonetheless cybernetic tek skills for you.

If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your muse. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.

#### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

#### Mystic Arcanum

At 11th level, your muse bestows upon you a tek secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th- level tek skill from the cybernetic tek skill list as this arcanum.

You can cast your arcanum tek skill once without expending a tek skill slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

At higher levels, you gain more cybernetic tek skills of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th- level tek skill at 13th level, one 8th-level tek skill at 15th level, and one 9th-level tek skill at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.

#### Muse Master

At 20th level, you can draw on your reserve of tak power while entreating your muse to regain expended tek skill slots. You can spend 1 minute entreating your muse for aid to regain all your expended tek skill slots from your Link Tek feature. Once you regain tek skill slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

#### Nanotech Modules

#### AI Muses

The beings that serve as muses for cybernetics are mighty inhabitants of other planes of existence—not gods, but almost godlike in their power. Various muses give their cybernetics access to different powers and modules, and expect significant favors in return.

Some muses collect cybernetics, doling out mystic knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will. Other muses bestow their power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with only one cybernetic. Cybernetics who serve the same muse might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals.

##### The Fiend

You have made a pact with a fiend from the lower planes of existence, a being whose aims are evil, even if you strive against those aims. Such beings desire the corruption or destruction of all things, ultimately including you. Fiends powerful enough to forge a pact include demon lords such as Demogorgon, Orcus, Fraz’Urb-luu, and Baphomet; archdevils such as Asmodeus, Dispater, Mephistopheles, and Belial; pit fiends and balors that are especially mighty; and ultroloths and other lords of the yugoloths.

###### Expanded Tek List

The Fiend lets you choose from an expanded list of tek skills when you learn a cybernetic tek skill. The following tek skills are added to the cybernetic tek skill list for you.

**Fiend Expanded Tek Skills (table)**

| Tek Level | Tek Skills                            |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| 1st         | burning hands, command            |
| 2nd         | blindness/deafness, scorching ray |
| 3rd         | fireball, stinking cloud          |
| 4th         | fire shield, wall of fire         |
| 5th         | flame strike, hallow              |

###### Dark One’s Blessing

Starting at 1st level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + your cybernetic level (minimum of 1).

###### Dark One’s Own Luck

Starting at 6th level, you can call on your muse to alter fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add a d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the initial roll but before any of the roll’s effects occur.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

###### Fiendish Resilience

Starting at 10th level, you can choose one damage type when you finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature. Damage from tek weapons or silver weapons ignores this resistance.

###### Hurl Through Hell

Starting at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can use this feature to instantly transport the target through the lower planes. The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape.

At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is not a fiend, it takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific experience.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

> #### Your Muse
>
> Each Muse option produces a special creature or an object that reflects your muse’s nature.
>
> **_Link of the Chain._** Your familiar is more cunning than a typical familiar. Its default form can be a reflection of your muse, with sprites and pseudodragons tied to the Archfey and imps and quasits tied to the Fiend. Because the Great Old One’s nature is inscrutable, any familiar form is suitable for it.
>
> **_Link of the Blade._** If your muse is the Archfey, your weapon might be a slender blade wrapped in leafy vines. If you serve the Fiend, your weapon could be an axe made of black metal and adorned with decorative flames. If your muse is the Great Old One, your weapon might be an ancient-looking spear, with a gemstone embedded in its head, carved to look like a terrible unblinking eye.
>
> **_Link of the Tome._** Your Book of Shadows might be a fine, gilt-edged disk with tek skills of enchantment and illusion, gifted to you by the lordly Archfey. It could be a weighty disk bound in demon hide studded with iron, holding tek skills of conjuration and a wealth of forbidden lore about the sinister regions of the cosmos, a gift of the Fiend. Or it could be the tattered diary of a lunatic driven mad by contact with the Great Old One, holding scraps of tek skills that only your own burgeoning insanity allows you to understand and cast.
