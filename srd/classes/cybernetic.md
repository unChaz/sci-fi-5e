## Bionic Enhancements

At 1st level, to allow you to to seamlessly interface with computers, you have been upgraded with bionic enhancements. Your sleeve must be synthetic, bionic, or you have paid to have custom bionic enhancements installed.

## AI Patron

At 1st level, through your bionic enhancements, you have bonded with an ancient alien AI called a "Symbiote". Your Symbiote makes it easy for you to interface with nearby networks and computers, and usually comes with a quirky personality.

## Symbiote Tek

Your arcane research and the tek bestowed on you by your Symbiote have given you facility with tek skills.

### Cantrips

You know two cantrips of your choice from the cybernetic tek skill list. You learn additional cybernetic cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cybernetic table.

```
```

### Tek Slots

The Cybernetic table shows how many tek skill slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your tek skill slots are the same level. To cast one of your cybernetic tek skills of 1st level or higher, you must expend a tek skill slot. You regain all expended tek skill slots when you finish a short or long rest.

For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level tek skill slots. To cast the 1st-level tek skill *shockwave*, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level tek skill.

### Tek Skills Known of 1st Level and Higher

At 1st level, you know two 1st-level tek skills of your choice from the cybernetic tek skill list.

The Tek Skills Known column of the Cybernetic table shows when you learn more cybernetic tek skills of your choice of 1st level and higher. A tek skill you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new cybernetic tek skill, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the cybernetic tek skills you know and replace it with another tek skill from the cybernetic tek skill list, which also must be of a level for which you have tek skill slots.

</div>
### Tekcasting Ability

Charisma + Will is your Tekcasting ability for your cybernetic tek skills, so you use your Charisma whenever a tek skill refers to your Tekcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cybernetic tek skill you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Tek save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier + your Will modifier

**Tek attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier + your Will modifier + your Wit modifier

### Tekcasting Focus

You can use an tekcaster as a Tekcasting focus for your cybernetic tek skills.

## Nanotech Modules

Your Symbiote provides you with access to alien nanotech that imbue you with an abiding tek ability.

At 2nd level, you gain two nanotech modules of your choice. Your module options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain cybernetic levels, you gain additional modules of your choice, as shown in the Modules Known column of the Cybernetic table.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the modules you know and replace it with another module that you could learn at that level.

## Symbiotic Links

At 3rd level, your Symbiote gives you one of the following features of your choice.

### Link of the Drone

You learn the *find familiar* tek skill and can cast it as a ritual. The tek skill doesn't count against your number of tek skills known.

When you cast the tek skill, the form of your familiar is a recon drone with a fly speed of 60, 13 AC, 7 HP, Perception +3, Stealth +4, 60ft of darkvision, 10ft of blindsight.

The familiar is controlled by your Symbiote, and you gain all normal benefits of a familiar.

Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its reaction.

### Link of the Blade

You can use your action to create a Nanoblade in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as tek for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nontek attacks and damage.

Your Nanoblade disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.

\page

You can transform one tek weapon into your Nanoblade by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your Nanoblade thereafter. You can't affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your Nanoblade if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.

### Link of the Tome

Your Symbiote gives you access to more tekskills. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class's tek skill list (the three needn't be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don't count against your number of cantrips known. If they don't appear on the cybernetic tek skill list, they are nonetheless cybernetic tek skills for you.

## Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

## Mystic Arcanum

At 11th level, your Symbiote bestows upon you a tek secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th- level tek skill from the cybernetic tek skill list as this arcanum.

You can cast your arcanum tek skill once without expending a tek skill slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

At higher levels, you gain more cybernetic tek skills of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th- level tek skill at 13th level, one 8th-level tek skill at 15th level, and one 9th-level tek skill at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.

## Symbiote Master

At 20th level, you can draw on your reserve of tak power while entreating your Symbiote to regain expended tek skill slots. You can spend 1 minute entreating your Symbiote for aid to regain all your expended tek skill slots from your Link Tek feature. Once you regain tek skill slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

```

## AI Symbiotes

The beings that serve as Symbiotes for cybernetics are ancient alien AI that sat dormant for thousands of years. Once you form a link with your Symbiote, it makes a copy of itself inside your cybernetic circuitry.

### The Fiend

You have formed a bond with the remnants of an AI from before the great AI war, a being whose aims are evil, even if you strive against those aims. Such beings desire the corruption or destruction of all things, ultimately including you. These AI, while symbiotic to you, and cannot function outside of your body, are constantly tempting you to do evil things, and is obsessed with destruction.

## Expanded Tek List

The Fiend lets you choose from an expanded list of tek skills when you learn a cybernetic tek skill. The following tek skills are added to the cybernetic tek skill list for you.

**Fiend Expanded Tek Skills (table)**

| Tek Level | Tek Skills                            |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| 1st         | burning hands, command            |
| 2nd         | blindness/deafness, scorching ray |
| 3rd         | fireball, stinking cloud          |
| 4th         | fire shield, wall of fire         |
| 5th         | flame strike, hallow              |

## Dark One's Blessing

Starting at 1st level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + your cybernetic level (minimum of 1).

## Dark One's Own Luck

Starting at 6th level, you can call on your Symbiote to alter fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add a d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the initial roll but before any of the roll's effects occur.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Fiendish Resilience

Starting at 10th level, you can choose one damage type when you finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature. Damage from tek weapons or silver weapons ignores this resistance.

## Hurl Through Hell

Starting at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can use this feature to instantly transport the target through the lower planes. The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape.

At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is not a fiend, it takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific experience.

### The Hexblade

You have made a bond with an ancient alien nanoblade. These Hexblades were created to destroy only evil, and were designed to transform themselves into harmless when a holder attempted to do evil with them. Over the ages their AI has evolved to discover its own ambitions, and attempts to use you to accomplish them.

## Expanded Tek List

The Fiend lets you choose from an expanded list of tek skills when you learn a cybernetic tek skill. The following tek skills are added to the cybernetic tek skill list for you.

**Fiend Expanded Tek Skills (table)**

| Tek Level | Tek Skills                            |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| 1st         | shield, wrathful smite          |
| 2nd         | blur, branding smite |
| 3rd         | blink, elemental weapon          |
| 4th         | phantasmal killer, staggering smite |
| 5th         | banishing smite, cone of cold |

## Blade Hex

Starting at 1st level, you gain the ability to place a baleful curse on someone. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target is cursed for 1 minute. The curse ends early if the target dies, you die, or you are incapacitated. Until the curse ends, you gain the following benefits:

- You gain a bonus to damage rolls against the cursed target. The bonus equals your proficiency bonus.
- Any attack roll you make against the cursed target is a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.
- If the cursed target dies, you regain hit points equal to your warlock level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 hit point).
- You can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.

\page

## Hex Warrior

At 1st level, you acquire the training necessary to effectively arm yourself for battle. You gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and martial weapons.

The influence of your patron also allows you to mystically channel your will through a particular weapon. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one weapon that you are proficient with and that lacks the two-handed property. When you attack with that weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest. If you later gain the Pact of the Blade feature, this benefit extends to every pact weapon you conjure with that feature, no matter the weapon's type.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Accursed Specter

Starting at 6th level, you can curse the soul of a person you slay, temporarily binding it to your service. When you slay a humanoid, you can cause its spirit to rise from its corpse as a specter, the statistics for which are in the Monster Manual. When the specter appears, it gains temporary hit points equal to half your warlock level. Roll initiative for the specter, which has its own turns. It obeys your verbal commands, and it gains a special bonus to its attack rolls equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +0).

The specter remains in your service until the end of your next long rest, at which point it vanishes to the afterlife.

Once you bind a specter with this feature, you can't use the feature again until you finish a long rest.

## Armor of Hexes
At 10th level, your hex grows more powerful. If the target cursed by your Hexblade's Curse hits you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to roll a d6. On a 4 or higher, the attack instead misses you, regardless of its roll.

## Master of Hexes
Starting at 14th level, you can spread your Hexblade's Curse from a slain creature to another creature. When the creature cursed by your Hexblade's Curse dies, you can apply the curse to a different creature you can see within 30 feet of you, provided you aren't incapacitated. When you apply the curse in this way, you don't regain hit points from the death of the previously cursed creature.
