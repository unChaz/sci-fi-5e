## Fantastic Beasts

---

A monster’s statistics, sometimes referred to as its **stat block**, provide the essential information that you need to run the monster.

>**Modifying Creatures**
>
>Despite the versatile collection of monsters in this book, you might be at a loss when it comes to finding the perfect creature for part of an adventure. Feel free to tweak an existing creature to make it into something more useful for you, perhaps by borrowing a trait or two from a different monster or by using a **variant** or **template**, such as the ones in this book. Keep in mind that modifying a monster, including when you apply a template to it, might change its challenge rating.

#### Size

A monster can be Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, or Gargantuan. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. See the _Player’s Handbook_ for more information on creature size and space.

**Size Categories (table)**

| Size       | Space                  | Examples            |
|------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Tiny       | 2½ by 2½ ft.           | Imp, sprite         |
| Small      | 5 by 5 ft.             | Giant rat, goblin   |
| Medium     | 5 by 5 ft.             | Orc, werewolf       |
| Large      | 10 by 10 ft.           | Hippogriff, ogre    |
| Huge       | 15 by 15 ft.           | Fire giant, treant  |
| Gargantuan | 20 by 20 ft. or larger | Kraken, purple worm |

#### Type

A monster’s type speaks to its fundamental nature. Certain tek skills, alien artifacts, class features, and other effects in the game interact in special ways with creatures of a particular type. For example, an _bullet of dragon slaying_ deals extra damage not only to dragons but also other creatures of the dragon type, such as dragon turtles and wyverns.

The game includes the following monster types, which have no rules of their own.

**Aberrations** are utterly alien beings. Many of them have innate tek abilities drawn from the creature’s alien mind rather than the mystical forces of the world. The quintessential aberrations are aboleths, beholders, mind flayers, and slaadi.

**Beasts** are nonhumanoid creatures that are a natural part of the futuristic ecology. Some of them have tek powers, but most are unintelligent and lack any society or language. Beasts include all varieties of ordinary animals, dinosaurs, and giant versions of animals.

**Celestials** are creatures native to the Upper

Planes. Many of them are the servants of deities, employed as messengers or agents in the mortal realm and throughout the planes. Celestials are good by nature, so the exceptional celestial who strays from a good alignment is a horrifying rarity. Celestials include angels, couatls, and pegasi.

**Constructs** are made, not born. Some are programmed by their creators to follow a simple set of instructions, while others are imbued with sentience and capable of independent thought. Golems are the iconic constructs. Many creatures native to the outer plane of Mechanus, such as modrons, are constructs shaped from the raw material of the plane by the will of more powerful creatures.

**Dragons** are large reptilian creatures of ancient origin and tremendous power. True dragons, including the good metallic dragons and the evil chromatic dragons, are highly intelligent and have innate tek. Also in this category are creatures distantly related to true dragons, but less powerful, less intelligent, and less tek, such as wyverns and pseudodragons.

**Elementals** are creatures native to the elemental planes. Some creatures of this type are little more than animate masses of their respective elements, including the creatures simply called elementals. Others have biological forms infused with elemental energy. The races of genies, including djinn and efreet, form the most important civilizations on the elemental planes. Other elemental creatures include azers, invisible stalkers, and water weirds.

**Fey** are tek creatures closely tied to the forces of nature. They dwell in twilight groves and misty forests. In some worlds, they are closely tied to the Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie. Some are also found in the Outer Planes, particularly the planes of Arborea and the Beastlands. Fey include dryads, pixies, and satyrs.

**Fiends** are creatures of wickedness that are native to the Lower Planes. A few are the servants of deities, but many more labor under the leadership of archdevils and demon princes. Evil priests and mages sometimes summon fiends to the material world to do their bidding. If an evil celestial is a rarity, a good fiend is almost inconceivable. Fiends include demons, devils, hell hounds, rakshasas, and yugoloths.

**Giants** tower over humans and their kind. They are humanlike in shape, though some have multiple heads (ettins) or deformities (fomorians). The six varieties of true giant are hill giants, stone giants, frost giants, fire giants, cloud giants, and storm giants. Besides these, creatures such as ogres and trolls are giants.

**Humanoids** are the main peoples of a futuristic gaming world, both civilized and savage, including humans and a tremendous variety of other species. They have language and culture, few if any innate tek abilities (though most humanoids can learn Tekcasting), and a bipedal form. The most common humanoid races are the ones most suitable as player characters: humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings. Almost as numerous but far more savage and brutal, and almost uniformly evil, are the races of goblinoids (goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears), orcs, gnolls, lizardfolk, and kobolds.

**Monstrosities** are monsters in the strictest sense—frightening creatures that are not ordinary, not truly natural, and almost never benign. Some are the results of tek experimentation gone awry (such as owlbears), and others are the product of terrible hacks (including minotaurs and yuan-ti). They defy categorization, and in some sense serve as a catch-all category for creatures that don’t fit into any other type.

**Oozes** are gelatinous creatures that rarely have a fixed shape. They are mostly subterranean, dwelling in caves and dungeons and feeding on refuse, carrion, or creatures unlucky enough to get in their way. Black puddings and gelatinous cubes are among the most recognizable oozes.

**Plants** in this context are vegetable creatures, not ordinary flora. Most of them are ambulatory, and some are carnivorous. The quintessential plants are the shambling mound and the treant. Fungal creatures such as the gas spore and the myconid also fall into this category.

**Undead** are once-living creatures brought to a horrifying state of undeath through the practice of necromantic tek or some unholy hack. Undead include walking corpses, such as vampires and zombies, as well as bodiless spirits, such as ghosts and specters.

##### Tags

A monster might have one or more tags appended to its type, in parentheses. For example, an orc has the _humanoid (orc)_ type. The parenthetical tags provide additional categorization for certain creatures. The tags have no rules of their own, but something in the game, such as a alien artifact, might refer to them. For instance, a spear that is especially effective at fighting demons would work against any monster that has the demon tag.

#### Alignment

A monster’s alignment provides a clue to its disposition and how it behaves in a roleplaying or combat situation. For example, a chaotic evil monster might be difficult to reason with and might attack characters on sight, whereas a neutral monster might be willing to negotiate. See the _Player’s Handbook_ for descriptions of the different alignments.

The alignment specified in a monster’s stat block is the default. Feel free to depart from it and change a monster’s alignment to suit the needs of your campaign. If you want a good-aligned green dragon or an evil storm giant, there’s nothing stopping you.

Some creatures can have **any alignment**. In other words, you choose the monster’s alignment. Some monster’s alignment entry indicates a tendency or aversion toward law, chaos, good, or evil. For example, a berserker can be any chaotic alignment (chaotic good, chaotic neutral, or chaotic evil), as befits its wild nature.

Many creatures of low intelligence have no comprehension of law or chaos, good or evil. They don’t make moral or ethical choices, but rather act on instinct. These creatures are **unaligned**, which means they don’t have an alignment.

#### Armor Class

A monster that wears armor or carries A medkit has an Armor Class (AC) that takes its armor, shield, and Dexterity into account. Otherwise, a monster’s AC is based on its Dexterity modifier and natural armor, if any. If a monster has natural armor, wears armor, or carries A medkit, this is noted in parentheses after its AC value.

#### Hit Points

A monster usually dies or is destroyed when it drops to 0 hit points. For more on hit points, see the _Player’s Handbook_.

A monster’s hit points are presented both as a die expression and as an average number. For example, a monster with 2d8 hit points has 9 hit points on average (2 × 4½).

A monster’s size determines the die used to calculate its hit points, as shown in the Hit Dice by Size table.

#### Hit Dice by Size

| Monster Size | Hit Die | Average HP per Die |
|--------------|---------|--------------------|
| Tiny         | d4      | 2½                 |
| Small        | d6      | 3½                 |
| Medium       | d8      | 4½                 |
| Large        | d10     | 5½                 |
| Huge         | d12     | 6½                 |
| Gargantuan   | d20     | 10½                |


A monster’s Constitution modifier also affects the number of hit points it has. Its Constitution modifier is multiplied by the number of Hit Dice it possesses, and the result is added to its hit points. For example, if a monster has a Constitution of 12 (+1 modifier) and 2d8 Hit Dice, it has 2d8 + 2 hit points (average 11).

#### Speed

A monster’s speed tells you how far it can move on its turn. For more information on speed, see the _Player’s Handbook_.

All creatures have a walking speed, simply called the monster’s speed. Creatures that have no form of ground-based locomotion have a walking speed of 0 feet.

Some creatures have one or more of the following additional movement modes.

##### Burrow

A monster that has a burrowing speed can use that speed to move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. A monster can’t burrow through solid rock unless it has a special trait that allows it to do so.

##### Climb

A monster that has a climbing speed can use all or part of its movement to move on vertical surfaces. The monster doesn’t need to spend extra movement to climb.

##### Fly

A monster that has a flying speed can use all or part of its movement to fly. Some monsters have the ability to **hover**, which makes them hard to knock out of the air (as explained in the rules on flying in the _Player’s Handbook_). Such a monster stops hovering when it dies.

##### Swim

A monster that has a swimming speed doesn’t need to spend extra movement to swim.

#### Ability Scores

Every monster has six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) and corresponding modifiers. For more information on ability scores and how they’re used in play, see the _Player’s Handbook_.

#### Saving Throws

The Saving Throws entry is reserved for creatures that are adept at resisting certain kinds of effects. For example, a creature that isn’t easily charmed or frightened might gain a bonus on its Wisdom saving throws. Most creatures don’t have special saving throw bonuses, in which case this section is absent.

A saving throw bonus is the sum of a monster’s relevant ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is determined by the monster’s challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table).

**Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating (table)**

| Challenge | Proficiency Bonus |
|-----------|-------------------|
| 0         | +2                |
| 1/8       | +2                |
| 1/4       | +2                |
| 1/2       | +2                |
| 1         | +2                |
| 2         | +2                |
| 3         | +2                |
| 4         | +2                |
| 5         | +3                |
| 6         | +3                |
| 7         | +3                |
| 8         | +3                |
| 9         | +4                |

| 12        | +4                |
| 13        | +5                |
| 14        | +5                |
| 15        | +5                |
| 16        | +5                |
| 17        | +6                |
| 18        | +6                |
| 19        | +6                |
| 20        | +6                |
| 21        | +7                |
| 22        | +7                |
| 23        | +7                |
| 24        | +7                |
| 25        | +8                |
| 26        | +8                |
| 27        | +8                |
| 28        | +8                |
| 29        | +9                |
| 30        | +9                |

#### Skills

The Skills entry is reserved for monsters that are proficient in one or more skills. For example, a monster that is very perceptive and stealthy might have bonuses to Wisdom (Perception) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

A skill bonus is the sum of a monster’s relevant ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is determined by the monster’s challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table). Other modifiers might apply. For instance, a monster might have a larger-than-expected bonus (usually double its proficiency bonus) to account for its heightened expertise.

#### Vulnerabilities, Resistances, and Immunities

Some creatures have vulnerability, resistance, or immunity to certain types of damage. Particular creatures are even resistant or immune to damage from nontek attacks (a tek attack is an attack delivered by a tek skill, a alien artifact, or another tek source). In addition, some creatures are immune to certain conditions.

#### Senses

The Senses entry notes a monster’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score, as well as any special senses the monster might have. Special senses are described below.

##### Blindsight

A monster with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius.

Creatures without eyes, such as grimlocks and gray oozes, typically have this special sense, as do creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons.

If a monster is naturally blind, it has a parenthetical note to this effect, indicating that the radius of its blindsight defines the maximum range of its perception.

##### Darkvision

A monster with darkvision can see in the dark within a specific radius. The monster can see in dim light within the radius as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. The monster can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Many creatures that live underground have this special sense.

#### Tremorsense

A monster with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations within a specific radius, provided that the monster and the source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance. Tremorsense can’t be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures. Many burrowing creatures, such as ankhegs and umber hulks, have this special sense.

#### Truesight

A monster with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and tek darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by tek. Furthermore, the monster can see into the Ethereal Plane within the same range.

>**Armor, Weapon, and Tool Proficiencies**
>
>Assume that a creature is proficient with its armor, weapons, and tools. If you swap them out, you decide whether the creature is proficient with its new equipment.
>
>For example, a hill giant typically wears hide armor and wields a greatclub. You could equip a hill giant with scarab skin and a pulse axe instead, and assume the giant is proficient with both, one or the other, or neither.

>See the _Player’s Handbook_ for rules on using armor or weapons without proficiency.

#### Languages

The languages that a monster can speak are listed in alphabetical order. Sometimes a monster can understand a language but can’t speak it, and this is noted in its entry. A “—” indicates that a creature neither speaks nor understands any language.

##### Telepathy

Telepathy is a tek ability that allows a monster to communicate mentally with another creature within a specified range. The contacted creature doesn’t need to share a language with the monster to communicate in this way with it, but it must be able to understand at least one language. A creature without telepathy can receive and respond to telepathic messages but can’t initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation.

A telepathic monster doesn’t need to see a contacted creature and can end the telepathic contact at any time. The contact is broken as soon as the two creatures are no longer within range of each other or if the telepathic monster contacts a different creature within range. A telepathic monster can initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation without using an action, but while the monster is incapacitated, it can’t initiate telepathic contact, and any current contact is terminated.

A creature within the area of an _antitek field_ or in any other location where tek doesn’t function can’t send or receive telepathic messages.

#### Challenge

A monster’s **challenge rating** tells you how great a threat the monster is. An appropriately equipped and well-rested party of four adventurers should be able to defeat a monster that has a challenge rating equal to its level without suffering any deaths. For example, a party of four 3rd-level characters should find a monster with a challenge rating of 3 to be a worthy challenge, but not a deadly one.

Monsters that are significantly weaker than 1st- level characters have a challenge rating lower than 1. Monsters with a challenge rating of 0 are insignificant except in large numbers; those with no effective attacks are worth no experience points, while those that have attacks are worth 10 XP each.

Some monsters present a greater challenge than even a typical 20th-level party can handle. These monsters have a challenge rating of 21 or higher and are specifically designed to test player skill.

##### Experience Points

The number of experience points (XP) a monster is worth is based on its challenge rating. Typically, XP is awarded for defeating the monster, although the GM may also award XP for neutralizing the threat posed by the monster in some other manner.

Unless something tells you otherwise, a monster summoned by a tek skill or other tek ability is worth the XP noted in its stat block.

**Experience Points by Challenge Rating (table)**

| Challenge | XP      |
|-----------|---------|
| 0         | 0 or 10 |
| 1/8       | 25      |
| 1/4       | 50      |
| 1/2       | 100     |
| 1         | 200     |
| 2         | 450     |
| 3         | 700     |
| 4         | 1,100   |
| 5         | 1,800   |
| 6         | 2,300   |
| 7         | 2,900   |
| 8         | 3,900   |
| 14        | 11,500  |
| 15        | 13,000  |
| 16        | 15,000  |
| 17        | 18,000  |
| 18        | 20,000  |
| 19        | 22,000  |
| 20        | 25,000  |
| 21        | 33,000  |
| 22        | 41,000  |
| 23        | 50,000  |
| 24        | 62,000  |
| 25        | 75,000  |

#### Special Traits

Special traits (which appear after a monster’s challenge rating but before any actions or reactions) are characteristics that are likely to be relevant in a combat encounter and that require some explanation.

##### Innate Tekcasting

A monster with the innate ability to cast tek skills has the Innate Tekcasting special trait. Unless noted otherwise, an innate tek skill of 1st level or higher is always cast at its lowest possible level and can’t be cast at a higher level. If a monster has a cantrip where its level matters and no level is given, use the monster’s challenge rating.

An innate tek skill can have special rules or restrictions. For example, a drow mage can innately cast the _levitate_ tek skill, but the tek skill has a “self only” restriction, which means that the tek skill affects only the drow mage.

A monster’s innate tek skills can’t be swapped out with other tek skills. If a monster’s innate tek skills don’t require attack rolls, no attack bonus is given for them.

##### Tekcasting

A monster with the Tekcasting special trait has a tekcaster level and tek skill slots, which it uses to cast its tek skills of 1st level and higher (as explained in the _Player’s Handbook_). The tekcaster level is also used for any cantrips included in the feature.

The monster has a list of tek skills known or prepared from a specific class. The list might also include tek skills from a feature in that class, such as the Divine Domain feature of the priest or the Morph Circle feature of the morph. The monster is considered a member of that class when attuning to or using a alien artifact that requires membership in the class or access to its tek skill list.

A monster can cast a tek skill from its list at a higher level if it has the tek skill slot to do so. For example, a drow mage with the 3rd-level _lightning bolt_ tek skill can cast it as a 5th-level tek skill by using one of its 5th-level greater or lesser threat than suggested by its challenge rating.

##### Psionics

A monster that casts tek skills using only the power of its mind has the psionics tag added to its Tekcasting or Innate Tekcasting special trait. This tag carries no special rules of its own, but other parts of the game might refer to it. A monster that has this tag typically doesn’t require any components to cast its tek skills.

#### Actions

When a monster takes its action, it can choose from the options in the Actions section of its stat block or use one of the actions available to all creatures, such as the Dash or Hide action, as described in the _Player’s Handbook_.

##### Melee and Ranged Attacks

The most common actions that a monster will take in combat are melee and ranged attacks. These can be tek skill attacks or weapon attacks, where the “weapon” might be a manufactured item or a natural weapon, such as a claw or tail spike. For more information on different kinds of attacks, see the _Player’s Handbook_.

***Creature vs. Target.*** The target of a melee or ranged attack is usually either one creature or one target, the difference being that a “target” can be a creature or an object.

***Hit.*** Any damage dealt or other effects that occur as a result of an attack hitting a target are described after the “_Hit_” notation. You have the option of taking average damage or rolling the damage; for this reason, both the average damage and the die expression are presented.

***Miss.*** If an attack has an effect that occurs on a miss, that information is presented after the “_Miss:_” notation.

#### Multiattack

A creature that can make multiple attacks on its turn has the Multiattack action. A creature can’t use Multiattack when making an opportunity attack, which must be a single melee attack.

#### Ammunition

A monster carries enough ammunition to make its ranged attacks. You can assume that a monster has 2d4 pieces of ammunition for a thrown weapon attack, and 2d10 pieces of ammunition for a projectile weapon such as a bow or crossbow.

### Reactions

If a monster can do something special with its reaction, that information is contained here. If a creature has no special reaction, this section is absent.

### Limited Usage

Some special abilities have restrictions on the number of times they can be used.

**_X/Day_**. The notation “X/Day” means a special ability can be used X number of times and that a monster must finish a long rest to regain expended uses. For example, “1/Day” means a special ability can be used once and that the monster must finish a long rest to use it again.

**_Recharge X–Y_**. The notation “Recharge X–Y” means a monster can use a special ability once and that the ability then has a random chance of recharging during each subsequent round of combat. At the start of each of the monster’s turns, roll a d6. If the roll is one of the numbers in the recharge notation, the monster regains the use of the special ability. The ability also recharges when the monster finishes a short or long rest.

For example, “Recharge 5–6” means a monster can use the special ability once. Then, at the start of the monster’s turn, it regains the use of that ability if it rolls a 5 or 6 on a d6.

**_Recharge after a Short or Long Rest_**. This notation means that a monster can use a special ability once and then must finish a short or long rest to use it again.

>**Grapple Rules for Monsters**
>
>Many monsters have special attacks that allow them to quickly grapple prey. When a monster hits with such an attack, it doesn’t need to make an additional ability check to determine whether the grapple succeeds, unless the attack says otherwise.
>
>A creature grappled by the monster can use its action to try to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Physique) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against the escape DC in the monster’s stat block. If no escape DC is given, assume the DC is 10 + the monster’s Strength (Physique) modifier.

#### Equipment

A stat block rarely refers to equipment, other than armor or weapons used by a monster. A creature that customarily wears clothes, such as a humanoid, is assumed to be dressed appropriately.

You can equip monsters with additional gear and trinkets however you like, and you decide how much of a monster’s equipment is recoverable after the creature is slain and whether any of that equipment is still usable. A battered suit of armor made for a monster is rarely usable by someone else, for instance.

If a Tekcasting monster needs material components to cast its tek skills, assume that it has the material components it needs to cast the tek skills in its stat block.

### Legendary Creatures

A legendary creature can do things that ordinary creatures can’t. It can take special actions outside its turn, and it might exert tek influence for miles around.

If a creature assumes the form of a legendary creature, such as through a tek skill, it doesn’t gain that form’s legendary actions, lair actions, or regional effects.

#### Legendary Actions

A legendary creature can take a certain number of special actions—called legendary actions—outside its turn. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. A creature regains its spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. It can forgo using them, and it can’t use them while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it can’t use them until after its first turn in the combat.

#### A Legendary Creature’s Lair

A legendary creature might have a section describing its lair and the special effects it can create while there, either by act of will or simply by being present. Such a section applies only to a legendary creature that spends a great deal of time in its lair.

##### Lair Actions

If a legendary creature has lair actions, it can use them to harness the ambient tek in its lair. On initiative count 20 (losing all initiative ties), it can use one of its lair action options. It can’t do so while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it can’t use one until after its first turn in the combat.

##### Regional Effects

The mere presence of a legendary creature can have strange and wondrous effects on its environment, as noted in this section. Regional effects end abruptly or dissipate over time when the legendary creature dies.

**_Amphibious_**. The aboleth can breathe air and water.

**_Mucous Cloud_**. While underwater, the aboleth is surrounded by transformative mucus. A creature that touches the aboleth or that hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is diseased for 1d4 hours. The diseased creature can breathe only underwater.

**_Probing Telepathy_**. If a creature communicates telepathically with the aboleth, the aboleth learns the creature’s greatest desires if the aboleth can see the creature.

**Actions**

**_Multiattack_**. The aboleth makes three tentacle attacks.

**_Tentacle_**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become diseased. The disease has no effect for 1 minute and can be removed by any tek that cures disease. After 1 minute, the diseased creature’s skin becomes translucent and slimy, the creature can’t regain hit points unless it is underwater, and the disease can be removed only by _heal_ or another disease-curing tek skill of 6th level or higher. When the creature is outside a body of water, it takes 6 (1d12) acid damage every 10 minutes unless moisture is applied to the skin before 10 minutes have passed.

**_Tail_**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 10 ft. one target. _Hit:_ 15 (3d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage.

**_Enslave (3/Day)_**. The aboleth targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the aboleth until the aboleth dies or until it is on a different plane of existence from the target. The charmed target is under the aboleth’s control and can’t take reactions, and the aboleth and the target can communicate telepathically with each other over any distance.

Whenever the charmed target takes damage, the target can repeat the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends. No more than once every 24 hours, the target can also repeat the saving throw when it is at least 1 mile away from the aboleth.

**Legendary Actions**

The aboleth can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The aboleth regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**_Detect_**. The aboleth makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.

**_Tail Swipe_**. The aboleth makes one tail attack.

**_Psychic Drain (Costs 2 Actions)_**. One creature charmed by the aboleth takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage, and the aboleth regains hit points equal to the damage the creature takes.

**_Amphibious_**. The chuul can breathe air and water.

**_Sense Tek_**. The chuul senses tek within 120 feet of it at will. This trait otherwise works like the _detect tek_ tek skill but isn’t itself tek.

**Actions**

**_Multiattack_**. The chuul makes two pincer attacks. If the chuul is grappling a creature, the chuul can also use its tentacles once.

**_Pincer_**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 14) if it is a Large or smaller creature and the chuul doesn’t have two other creatures grappled.

**_Tentacles_**. One creature grappled by the chuul must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. Until this poison ends, the target is paralyzed. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

#### Cloaker

_Large aberration, chaotic neutral_

**Armor Class** 14 (natural armor)

**Hit Points** 78 (12d10 + 12)

**Speed** 10 ft., fly 40 ft.

| STR     | DEX     | CON     | INT     | WIS     | CHA     |

**Skills** Stealth +5

**Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 11

**Languages** Deep Speech, Undercommon

**Challenge** 8 (3,900 XP)

**_Damage Transfer_**. While attached to a creature, the cloaker takes only half the damage dealt to it (rounded down), and that creature takes the other half.

**_False Appearance_**. While the cloaker remains motionless without its underside exposed, it is indistinguishable from a dark leather cloak.

**_Light Sensitivity_**. While in bright light, the cloaker has disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

**Actions**

**_Multiattack_**. The cloaker makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail.

**_Bite_**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage, and if the target is Large or smaller, the cloaker attaches to it. If the cloaker has advantage against the target, the cloaker attaches to the target’s head, and the target is blinded and unable to breathe while the cloaker is attached. While attached, the cloaker can make this attack only against the target and has advantage on the attack roll. The cloaker can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. A creature, including the target, can take its action to detach the cloaker by succeeding on a DC 16 Strength check.

**_Tail_**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage.

**_Moan_**. Each creature within 60 feet of the cloaker that can hear its moan and that isn’t an aberration must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of the cloaker’s next turn. If a creature’s saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the cloaker’s moan for the next 24 hours

**_Phantasms (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)_**. The cloaker creates three illusory duplicates of itself if it isn’t in bright light. The duplicates move with it and mimic its actions, shifting position so as to make it impossible to track which cloaker is the real one. If the cloaker is ever in an area of bright light, the duplicates disappear.

Whenever any creature targets the cloaker with an attack or a harmful tek skill while a duplicate remains, that creature rolls randomly to determine whether it targets the cloaker or one of the duplicates. A creature is unaffected by this tek effect if it can’t see or if it relies on senses other than sight.

A duplicate has the cloaker’s AC and uses its saving throws. If an attack hits a duplicate, or if a duplicate fails a saving throw against an effect that deals damage, the duplicate disappears.

**_Constrict_**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one Medium or smaller creature. _Hit:_ 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the couatl can’t constrict another target.

**_Change Shape_**. The couatl polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating equal to or less than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the couatl’s choice).

In a new form, the couatl retains its game statistics and ability to speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity, and other actions are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains any statistics and capabilities (except class features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the new form has but that it lacks. If the new form has a bite attack, the couatl can use its bite in that form.

If the target is Medium or smaller and the darkmantle has advantage on the attack roll, it attaches by engulfing the target’s head, and the target is also blinded and unable to breathe while the darkmantle is attached in this way.

While attached to the target, the darkmantle can attack no other creature except the target but has advantage on its attack rolls. The darkmantle’s speed also becomes 0, it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed, and it moves with the target.

A creature can detach the darkmantle by making a successful DC 13 Strength check as an action. On its turn, the darkmantle can detach itself from the target by using 5 feet of movement.

**_Darkness Aura (1/Day)_**. A 15-foot radius of tek darkness extends out from the darkmantle, moves with it, and spreads around corners. The darkness lasts as long as the darkmantle maintains concentration, up to 10 minutes (as if concentrating on a tek skill). Darkvision can’t penetrate this darkness, and no natural light can illuminate it.

If the save fails by 5 or more, the target also ages 1d4 × 10 years. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the frightened condition on itself on a success. If a target’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to this ghost’s Horrifying Visage for the next 24 hours. The aging effect can be reversed with a _greater restoration_ tek skill, but only within 24 hours of it occurring.

**_Possession (Recharge 6)_**. One humanoid that the ghost can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the ghost; the ghost then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. The ghost now controls the body but doesn’t deprive the target of awareness. The ghost can’t be targeted by any attack, tek skill, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target’s statistics, but doesn’t gain access to the target’s knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.

The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the ghost ends it as a bonus action, or the ghost is turned or forced out by an effect like the _dispel evil and good_ tek skill. When the possession ends, the ghost reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this ghost’s Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.

On each of its turns while berserk, the golem attacks the nearest creature it can see.

**Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 14

**Languages** Common, Draconic, Sylvan

**Challenge** 3 (700 XP)

**_Amphibious_**. The hag can breathe air and water.

**_Innate Tekcasting_**. The hag’s innate Tekcasting ability is Charisma (tek skill save DC 12). She can innately cast the following tek skills, requiring no material components:

At will: _dancing lights_, _minor illusion_, _vicious mockery_

**_Mimicry_**. The hag can mimic animal sounds and humanoid voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check.

**Actions**

**_Claws_**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.

**_Illusory Appearance_**. The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a tek illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.

The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have smooth skin, but someone touching her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.

**_Invisible Passage_**. The hag turns invisible until she attacks or casts a tek skill, or until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a tek skill). While invisible, she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can be tracked only by tek. Any equipment she wears or carries is invisible with her.

2/day each: _plane shift_ (self only), _ray of enfeeblement_, _sleep_

**_Tek Resistance_**. The hag has advantage on saving throws against tek skills and other tek effects.

**Actions**

**_Claws (Hag Form Only)_**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.

**_Change Shape_**. The hag polymorphs into a Small or Medium female humanoid, or back into her true form. Her statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment she is wearing or carrying isn’t transformed. She reverts to her true form if she dies.

**_Etherealness_**. The hag enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. To do so, the hag must have a _heartstone_ in her possession.

**_Nightmare Haunting (1/Day)_**. While on the Ethereal Plane, the hag touches a sleeping humanoid on the Material Plane. A _protection from evil and good_ tek skill cast on the target prevents this contact, as does a _tek circle_. As long as the contact persists, the target has dreadful visions. If these visions last for at least 1 hour, the target gains no benefit from its rest, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). If this effect reduces the target’s hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and if the target was evil, its soul is trapped in the hag’s _soul bag_. The reduction to the target’s hit point maximum lasts until removed by the _greater restoration_ tek skill or similar tek.

**Languages** Aquan, Common, Giant

**Challenge** 2 (450 XP)

**_Amphibious_**. The hag can breathe air and water.

**_Horrific Appearance_**. Any humanoid that starts its turn within 30 feet of the hag and can see the hag’s true form must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the hag is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag’s Horrific Appearance for the next 24 hours.

Unless the target is surprised or the revelation of the hag’s true form is sudden, the target can avert its eyes and avoid making the initial saving throw. Until the start of its next turn, a creature that averts its eyes has disadvantage on attack rolls against the hag.

**Actions**

**_Claws_**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.

**_Death Glare_**. The hag targets one frightened creature she can see within 30 feet of her. If the target can see the hag, it must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw against this tek or drop to 0 hit points.

**_Illusory Appearance_**. The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a tek illusion that makes her look like an ugly creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The effect ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.

The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have no claws, but someone touching her hand might feel the claws. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.

#### Half-Dragon Template

A beast, humanoid, giant, or monstrosity can become a half-dragon. It keeps its statistics, except as follows.

**_Luring Song_**. The harpy sings a tek melody. Every humanoid and giant within 300 feet of the harpy that can hear the song must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the song ends. The harpy must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the harpy is incapacitated.

While charmed by the harpy, a target is incapacitated and ignores the songs of other harpies. If the charmed target is more than 5 feet away from the harpy, the target must move on its turn toward the harpy by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet. It doesn’t avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the harpy, the target can repeat the saving throw. A charmed target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.

A target that successfully saves is immune to this harpy’s song for the next 24 hours.

**_Petrifying Gaze_**. When a creature that can see the medusa’s eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of the medusa, the medusa can force it to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw if the medusa isn’t incapacitated and can see the creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the _greater restoration_ tek skill or other tek.

Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can’t see the medusa until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the medusa in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.

If the medusa sees itself reflected on a polished surface within 30 feet of it and in an area of bright light, the medusa is, due to its hack, affected by its own gaze.

On a failed save, the cube enters the creature’s space, and the creature takes 10 (3d6) acid damage and is engulfed. The engulfed creature can’t breathe, is restrained, and takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the cube’s turns. When the cube moves, the engulfed creature moves with it.

An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 12 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the cube.

If its saving throw result is 5 or lower, the poisoned target falls unconscious for the same duration, or until it takes damage or another creature takes an action to shake it awake.

**_Heart Sight_**. The sprite touches a creature and knows the creature’s current emotional state. If the target fails a DC 10 Charisma saving throw, the sprite also knows the creature’s alignment. Celestials, fiends, and undead automatically fail the saving throw.

**_Blood Drain_**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage, and the stirge attaches to the target. While attached, the stirge doesn’t attack. Instead, at the start of each of the stirge’s turns, the target loses 5 (1d4 + 3) hit points due to blood loss.

The stirge can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. It does so after it drains 10 hit points of blood from the target or the target dies. A creature, including the target, can use its action to detach the stirge.

**_Shapechanger_**. The fiend can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid, or back into its true form. Without wings, the fiend loses its flying speed.

**Actions**

**_Claw (Fiend Form Only)_**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage.

**_Charm_**. One humanoid the fiend can see within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 1 day. The charmed target obeys the fiend’s verbal or telepathic commands. If the target suffers any harm or receives a suicidal command, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. If the target successfully saves against the effect, or if the effect on it ends, the target is immune to this fiend’s Charm for the next 24 hours.

The fiend can have only one target charmed at a time. If it charms another, the effect on the previous target ends.

**_Draining Kiss_**. The fiend kisses a creature charmed by it or a willing creature. The target must make a DC 15

Constitution saving throw against this tek, taking 32 (5d10 + 5) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**_Legendary Resistance (3/Day)_**. If the tarrasque fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**_Tek Resistance_**. The tarrasque has advantage on saving throws against tek skills and other tek effects.

**_Reflective Carapace_**. Any time the tarrasque is targeted by a
_tek missile_ tek skill, a line tek skill, or a tek skill that requires a ranged attack roll, roll a d6. On a 1 to 5, the tarrasque is unaffected. On a 6, the tarrasque is unaffected, and the effect is reflected back at the caster as though it originated from the tarrasque, turning the caster into the target.

**_Siege Monster_**. The tarrasque deals double damage to objects and structures.

**Actions**

**_Multiattack_**. The tarrasque can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes five attacks: one with its bite, two with its claws, one with its horns, and one with its tail. It can use its Swallow instead of its bite.

**_Bite_**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +19 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 36 (4d12 + 10) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 20). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the tarrasque can’t bite another target.

**_Frightful Presence_**. Each creature of the tarrasque’s choice within 120 feet of it and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the tarrasque is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the tarrasque’s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

**_Swallow_**. The tarrasque makes one bite attack against a Large or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target takes the bite’s damage, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the tarrasque, and it takes 56 (16d6) acid damage at the start of each of the tarrasque’s turns.

If the tarrasque takes 60 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the tarrasque must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the tarrasque. If the tarrasque dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 30 feet of movement, exiting prone.

**Legendary Actions**

The tarrasque can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The tarrasque regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

An animated tree acts as an ally of the treant. The tree remains animate for 1 day or until it dies; until the treant dies or is more than 120 feet from the tree; or until the treant takes a bonus action to turn it back into an inanimate tree.

**Senses** darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 17

**Languages** the languages it knew in life

**Challenge** 13 (10,000 XP)

**_Shapechanger_**. If the vampire isn’t in sunlight or running water, it can use its action to polymorph into a Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into its true form.

While in bat form, the vampire can’t speak, its walking speed is 5 feet, and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with it, but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

While in mist form, the vampire can’t take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature’s space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can’t pass through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to all nontek damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight.

**_Legendary Resistance (3/Day)_**. If the vampire fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**_Misty Escape_**. When it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting place, the vampire transforms into a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling unconscious, provided that it isn’t in sunlight or running water. If it can’t transform, it is destroyed.

While it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can’t revert to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its vampire form. It is then paralyzed until it regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in its resting place with 0 hit points, it regains 1 hit point.

**_Regeneration_**. The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn’t in sunlight or running water. If the vampire takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn’t function at the start of the vampire’s next turn.

**_Spider Climb_**. The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**_Vampire Weaknesses_**. The vampire has the following flaws:

_Forbiddance._ The vampire can’t enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.

_Harmed by Running Water._ The vampire takes 20 acid damage if it ends its turn in running water.

_Stake to the Heart._ If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into the vampire’s heart while the vampire is incapacitated in its resting place, the vampire is paralyzed until the stake is removed.

_Sunlight Hypersensitivity._ The vampire takes 20 radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

**Actions**

**_Multiattack (Vampire Form Only)_**. The vampire makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.

**_Unarmed Strike (Vampire Form Only)_**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage, the vampire can grapple the target (escape DC 18).

**_Bite (Bat or Vampire Form Only)_**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by the vampire, incapacitated, or restrained. _Hit:_ 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) radiation damage. The target’s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the radiation damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under the vampire’s control.

**_Charm_**. The vampire targets one humanoid it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the vampire, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this tek or be charmed by the vampire. The charmed target regards the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn’t under the vampire’s control, it takes the vampire’s requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for the vampire’s bite attack.

Each time the vampire or the vampire’s companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.

**_Children of the Night (1/Day)_**. The vampire calls 2d4 swarms of bats or rats, provided that the sun isn’t up. While outdoors, the vampire can call 3d6 wolves instead. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the vampire and obeying its spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until the vampire dies, or until the vampire dismisses them as a bonus action.

**Legendary Actions**

The vampire can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The vampire regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**_Move_**. The vampire moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
