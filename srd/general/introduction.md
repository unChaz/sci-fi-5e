# The Cryo-Emergent Handbook

## Introduction

Welcome to your new life, {{ cryo_emergent_first_name }}! The Sol Commerce Authority (SCA) is responsible for reorienting all preserved pre-stack cryogenically frozen humans into this new world.

Centuries ago it was common practice for terminally ill humans, or those with vast resources to facilitate the cryogenic preservation of their bodies to be revived when scientific advancement allowed.

You were not revived for one of the following reasons:

- Your sleeve was damaged and unsuitable to be revived.
- Your cryo insurance coverage was not comprehensive enough to cover the cost of sleeve repair.
- Your cryo insurance agency was waiting for your sleeve repair costs to become lower.
- The contract on your revival designated a date after HL-3404-C53 went into effect.

SCA legislation HL-3404-C53 dictates that all cryogenically preserved pre-stack natural humans that have not been revived to be confiscated by the SCA. Your consciousness has been legally conscripted into indentured servitude to the SCA until you have paid off your contract. Once oriented you will be assigned a job based on your aptitude - most likely hard labor. Welcome to the family!

## Persona
SCA assesses each emergent for personality traits. Scores are given to each trait at a 1:1 ratio. Scores range between -2 and 4.

Personality traits were the results of a two decades long psychological study at the Ganymede Institute. These traits were determined to be the most core quantification of the natural human personality. These traits are completely independent of physical form, and represent the human mind.

| Trait | Description|
|:----:|:-------------|
| Wit  | Mental sharpness and inventiveness; keen intelligence. |
| Will  | Mental fortitude. This is the mind’s ability to resist tek effectrs, and mental stress. |
| Intelligence | The ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills. |
| Wisdom | The soundness of an action or decision with regard to the application of experience, knowledge, and good judgment. |

> ##### Artificial Intelligence
> The concept of Artificial Intelligence as it applies today is likely very different during your first life. AI as you know it does not exist. Any AI programs are under strict regulations to do only simple tasks.

## Stack

Thanks to modern cloning techniques, and the availability of confiscated human bodies, death no longer needs to be permanent.

Each human is given a Stack that is installed at the base of the neck connected to your spinal cord. The Stack contains a complete record of your conscious mind. In the event of your death you can be given a new body. Additionally traveling across the solar system has never been faster with the ability to stream your stack backup to a new body. If you have the funds, you can even have a cloned body ready for you on the other side. 

If your stack is destroyed however, there is no bringing you back. That is called "true death". The punishment for murder has been lessened with the exception of those who have religious encoding specifying they do not wish to be spun back up.

Having two copies or more of the same stack is illegal, and punishable by the true death of all copies.

It is also possible to enter into a totally virtual environment via the stack. Using this method we can spin up a virtual instance of a person in VR to question them about thier death, or keep prisoners sedated inside a virtual environment which we control.

## Sleeve

Sleeve refers to a human body. Upon death, if your stack is recovered, you can purchase a new sleeve, or be provided one in the case of wrongful death, or if you are properly insured. 

Many available sleeves are either sold by their previous owner, confiscated from a criminal, or created in a cloning facilty.

Some sleeves have been genetically modified. Some have been upgraded with bionic hardware. There are even sleeves available that are totally synthetic.

Naturally born sleeves vary greatly, as the genetic diversity of humanity expanded when we spread out around the solar system.

### Quality Control
All sleeves must be appraised by the **Board of Quality Control** to ensure buyer protection. Sleeves are appraised with the following traits:


| Trait | Description |
|:----:|:-------------|
|Strength |Physical strength |
|Dexterity | Agility, reflex, and balance |
|Charisma | Beauty, appearance |
|Constitution | Overall health |

## Skills
Average skill levels can be derived from these core Sleeve Traits, and Persona Traits to give you a better idea of the effectiveness of a sleeve/stack combination. Each skill is a combination of 2 traits.

##### Skill Definition
| Skill | Trait Combinations |
|:----:|:-------------|
|Physique | Strength + Constitution |
|Acrobatics | Strength + Dexterity |
|Toughness | Constitution + Will |
|Intimidation | Strength + Wit |
|Medic | Will + Wisdom|
|Charm | Wit + Charisma|
|Stealth | Dexterity + Will|
|Perception | Wisdom + Wit|
|Arcana | Wisdom + Intelligence |
|Computers | Wit + Intelligence|
|Performance | Dexterity + Charisma|
|Tinker | Dexterity + Intelligence|
|Pilot | Dexterity + Intelligence|
|Knowledge | Wisdom + Intelligence |
|Trickery | Dexterity + Wit|
|Investigation | Will + Intelligence|
|Insight | Charisma + Wisdom |
|Diplomacy | Intelligence + Charisma |
|Nature | Wisdom + Will |
|Survival | Wisdom + Will |

### Skill Difficulty
In order to be successful at the given task, you roll the die, and add your skill score to the number you rolled. If the number is equal or higher than the difficulty score of the task, you were successful.

| Difficulty | Minimum Rolls |
|:----:|:-------------|
|Very Easy|10|
|Easy|15|
|Medium|20|
|Hard|25|
|Very Hard|30|
|Nearly Impossible|35|

The person determining the difficulty might increment the number on the table based on environmental conditions that might make the task easier or more difficult.

## Tekcasting
 Major advancements in technology have enabled the use of seemingly supernatural powers. Some humans have the ability to use tekcasters, devices discovered from a derelict alien spacestation.

### Focus
The focus used by those casting tek skills is called a Tekcaster. The tekcaster is a device worn on the wrist and is connected to the fingers. 

Using a combination of hand movements, vocal commands, and material components, the tekcaster can be used to cast tek skills. One can wield a weapon while wearing a tekcaster, but the hand must be free to use it.

Some tek skills require the use of certain quality gemstones. These special gemstones, sometimes called "tekstones" act as a power source for the tekcasters. In the case of more powerful spells, some result in the destruction of the gemstones, which can get expensive quickly.

<div style="margin-bottom: 180px"></div>

> ##### The two sources of Tek Skill
> #### Knowledge
> One method to cast tek skills is to learn how to use them. This often involves lots of studying and  memorization. Using this method, the sleeve you are in does not impact how effective you are at casting tek skills.
>
> Classes that use this type of tek are Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Warlock, and Wizard.
>
> #### Genetic Alteration
> Another way to cast tek skills is to be genetically modified to do so. This prevents you from having to memorize tek skills, but you must be equipped with an adequate sleeve that has been genetically modified.
>
> Usually sleeves with above average Charisma or Constitution are better suited to this type of casting.
>
> Classes that use this type of tek are Bards, Paladins, and Sorcerers.

\page

### Willpower
Regardless of the method of tek casting, Willpower is always at the core of casting tek skills. When estimating a caster’s tek ability, you add the relevant ability score to your Will score to determine your Tekcasting power. The only exception is Bard, which uses their Wit and Charisma score since their tek is a form of performance.

#### Sleeve Market
There are many ways to get a new sleeve. There are Sleeve Brokers that deal in used and confiscated sleeves. You can also have one custom cloned for you from a Cloning Facility, but that can be very expensive. You can also receive genetic enhancments on your current sleeve, or pay extra for a sleeve that has them installed. The process of getting genetic enhancments is long and painful.

#### Genetic Enhancements
*(Premium Upgrades)*

- Enhanced Muscle Memory: +1 PHY
- Thick Skinned: +1 CON
- Integrated Synapses: +1 DEX
- Curated Aesthetics: +1 CHA

Basic sleeve insurance does not cover genetic enhancements. You can upgrade for a cost to a maximum of +2 per trait.

|  Upgrades | Cost |
|:----:|:-------------|
|1| 50,000c|
|2| 90,000c|
|3| 130,000c|
|4| 160,000c|

Upgrades can be retained when transferring to a new sleeve, or a return of 80% of the upgrade cost will be returned to you.

## Feats
At every 4 stack levels the Board of Quality Control awards employees with a free stack or sleeve upgrade. These upgrades come in a form of a predefined “feat” or a genetic alteration or stack data upload.
A list of available feats can be provided upon request.

Alternatively, you can be awarded 2 points to be allocated towards a genetic sleeve upgrade, or a data upload to your stack.

### Genetic Upgrade Option
Based on the type of genetic alteration (Physique, Constitution, Dexterity, Charisma), you will either be issued a new similar sleeve, or given genetic enhancements to your current sleeve. You may be given the option to choose.

### Data Upload Option
One unit of data uploaded to your stack will be guaranteed to be enough to increase your Wit, Will, Intelligence or Wisdom assessment score by 1 point.

## Interplanetary Travel

Whether for business or pleasure, interplanetary travel is a very common occurance despite the fact that 85% of humans never leave their home planet. There are several ways to visit other planets.

#### Own a Ship
Of course the easiest way to travel is to own your own ship, but ships are extremely expensive. Unless you work for a large corporation, or are a high ranking officer in a planetary navy, you likely won't ever own your own ship.

#### Charter a Ship
An option for the wealthy is to charter a ship. There are all kinds of luxury and passenger vessels found at any space port ready to take on a new contract.

#### Buy Passage
Many freelance merchants that will let you hitch a ride for a minimal fee. These ships however are often slow, and sometimes make many stops before reaching your destination.

##### Estimated Ship Passage Fares
| Journey | Cabin | Cryo-Pod |
|:----:|:-------------|-----|
| Core - Rim | 2,000c  | 3,000c |
| Core - Belt  | 1,100c | 1,500c |
| Core - Venus | 800c | 1200c |
| Core - Mars | 1000c | 1500c |
| Core - Outer Rim | 5,000c | 8,000c |


#### Stack Transfer
By far the fastest way to travel if you don't mind Sleeve-hopping. You can rent or buy a sleeve on another planet, and for a modest fee have your stack transferred via uplink. 

If it is a two way trip, you can either pay to have your sleeve safely stored, or make back some of your money by renting it out while you aren't using it. Make sure you have good sleeve insurance first!

Each Planet has their own processing fees for handling stack upload/download.
